Someone once said: ""you can't get it right the first time"" and he was right. I
did commit mistakes, some of which were costly, before I was able to publish
my first electronic book. In this article, it's my aim to help you at least
minimize those mistakes so you can make the whole thing manageable.

# What's in your back yard?
! What’s in your back yard?
http://claywginn.com/wp-
content/uploads/et_temp/backyard-60877_172x172.jpg
_I 'm on vacation this week, so I'm posting some older articles. Hope you
enjoy this one._
__You ever think about what is in your back yard? Might seem like a bit of an
odd question, but it 's one that's been on my mind recently. It's really
pretty easy for me to answer. We've got a fort for the kids to play on, a
slide and a little house for the younger ones, some lawn furniture, a grill,
and a small patio. Seems pretty typical, doesn't it?
Now, if I just stopped there, this would make for a pretty pointless and
stupid post, so I'm not going to. What's interesting to me are the things that
I didn't describe that are back there, things that I don't expect or want you
to see. We have a new dog that's still a bit of a puppy and she likes to drag
things out the dog door and into the backyard. She doesn't typically chew them
up
except for shoes
she just takes them outside and deposits them between
the fort and the back door. One day my wife and I were talking while I was
driving home from work and she said, ""Don't look in the back yard when you get
home."" Naturally, I was curious why I was being restricted like this and she
replied with, ""Because it looks like a diaper bomb went off out there.""
Apparently Maggie had found a trash can in the bedroom where we had been
putting diapers and was taking them outside, one by one.
Now you might be wondering why I'm telling you about this and how it relates
to my point. You really need to be less like my son watching a movie,
constantly asking about what's going to happen, and be more patient. I'm only
250 words into this.
! Messy back yard
http://claywginn.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/04/messy_backyard-300x225.jpg
http://claywginn.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/04/messy_backyard.jpg When there is stuff strewn all over
the back yard, I hate going out there. It's surrounded by a fence so nobody
sees it and this removes just about any motivation I might have to clean it
up. I don't even like mowing out there. Normally, nobody knows about this
except for my family and it's not a big deal. However, last week, anyone
driving by my house knew about my lack of back yard cleanliness. After a
couple days of strong winds and one good storm, my already pathetic fence gave
up on one side of the house and came crashing down. I look outside during the
storm and notice three fence panels on the ground and two more waving like
fans at a football game who just realized the camera was turned their
direction. I was understandably disappointed that I would have to repair the
fence, but I was more disturbed that now people would be able to see into my
back yard and the sorry state it was in.
Last weekend while I was rebuilding the fence, I had plenty of time to think.
I started to realize that the way we maintain our house could really be a
metaphor for our own lives. I try to make sure that the front yard is fairly
well kept, always mowed and looking at least presentable. The front yard is
like my public life. It's lived out in front of anyone who can see it and what
goes on there isn't hidden in the least. Any words I speak in public are out
there for all to hear.
My back yard is a bit more guarded. I try to keep what is going on back there
private, but it doesn't always work, as evidenced by my fence falling in. Just
like that fence, sometimes my guard is down and people see a bit more of what
I'm really like. I might try to quickly build the fence back up but once
someone sees that back yard of my personality, they probably won't forget it,
especially if it contradicts what I normally do.
My point behind all this is that we need to be sure that what we display in
the front yard of our lives, our public face, is consistent with how we live
in the back yard of our life. We expect privacy there, but we should also
understand that at any moment that privacy can be broken, and all the things
that we try to hide from public view will be displayed for all to see.
Luke
12:2-3
http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2012:2-3&version=NKJV
tells us:
> 2 For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, nor hidden that
> will not be known. 3 Therefore whatever you have spoken in the dark will be
> heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms will
> be proclaimed on the housetops.
Let us live our lives so that what is proclaimed from the housetops is our
love for our Savior, our dedication to living our lives for the calling He has
given to us. We are the light of the world, shining like that city on a hill
to make known His sacrifice for us, not for our own glory, but for His. Pray
that we do not let the hidden part of our lives become a hindrance to the
spreading of His word.

Nope, didn't say a word. I'm ashamed to say this all came from looking at
ours.

# The slippery slope of morality
> The journey from your mind into your hands is shorter than you're thinking.
>
Be careful if you think you stand, you just might be sinking.
>
> \- ""Slow Fade"", Casting Crowns
The hard thing about trying to be a good, moral person is that you're
constantly being pulled towards those things you know you shouldn't be
involved in. Temptation has a way of dragging you back onto the wide path when
you've been trying to walk the straight and narrow.
Sometimes though, you make the choices yourself. You see that someone else is
letting slide what you think is wrong, so you begin to think it's OK too. It
could be swearing, movies, drinking, just about anything. You start to feel
pressure if you're the one that is different from everyone else and then you
begin to conform to the ways of those around you.
> And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of
> your mind, that you may prove what _is_ that good and acceptable and perfect
> will of God.
>
> \-
Romans
> 12:2
http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A2&version=NKJV&src=embed
>
NKJV
The little things add up, all the time. First, you decide to tell a little
white lie so that you don't get in trouble. You follow those with lies to
cover up the original lie. Years later, you're telling your spouse that you've
been at the office all day when really you've been at a bar, all because it's
become more natural to lie than to tell the truth.
Opening the door to any sin allows all sin to get a foothold in your life.
We've got to battle back sin with the Holy Spirit, actively engaging in the
fight and not passively allowing the enemy to roll over us. This is something
that doesn't come natural to any of us, it really is a struggle to do.
However, the reward for fighting back the sin in our lives is eternal.
Imagine that a worker notices a problem with a dam holding back millions of
gallons of water. Below that dam is a quaint little town, full of people going
about their everyday lives. If the worker notices a small leak in the dam,
should he fix the leak, or should he just say, ""Oh, it's just a small leak, it
should be fine."" Those millions of gallons of water are now placing pressure
on that small leak, causing it to grow a little bigger with each passing day.
Gradually, the leak turns into a gaping hole, allowing more water to pass
through, causing some minor issues in the little town. Still, the worker says,
""The dam is still standing, that hole isn't causing much damage. I'll ignore
it.""
Eventually, the gaping hole gives way to an actual dam break. Millions of
gallons of water are rushing down the hill towards the little town, destroying
everything in its path. The little town is destroyed, all the people are
injured or killed, and the dam worker justifies it by saying, ""The dam just
broke!""
Now, let's talk about sin this way. Maybe you've allowed a little sin into
your life, but you don't want to deal with it because it's not a big deal.
Everyone has small issues, right? Your family doesn't know about it and
everything looks normal. However, that sin is placing pressure on you and on
the rest of your life, wanting to allow more sin to come through.
Gradually, that sin grows into something that you and your family notice, but
you don't really identify the cause of the problem. You continue to justify it
by saying that everyone is doing it, it'll be OK. It's not causing too many
problems in your life so you just let it continue.
Finally, the dam breaks. You act out on your sin in a big way, destroying your
family, your reputation, and your relationship with God. You might say, ""I
don't know what happened, I wasn't myself, it just happened!""
This is what happens when we allow sin to erode our life. Our familiarity with
sin is unacceptable to God. We cannot be friendly with sin and friendly with
God at the same time. Through prayer, through devotion to Him, God can give us
the ability to overcome sin, but we have to make the effort to do so. We have
to pursue God so that He can renew our minds.
Are there areas where you need to battle back sin in your life? How can I pray
for you?

# Lessons learned from a week on vacation
It's been quite a week. We have one more night here at Walt Disney World, then
we are headed home. I'll give you a bit of a preview for next week though.
There are a few things I've noticed here that develop into great analogies for
life lessons. Anything from a large, burly fellow with a pink Disney Princess
backpack, to using the bathroom at the dinner table, to the lack of wisdom in
crowds. I think you'll enjoy these.
However, today I'd like to share with a you a few lessons that have been
forcefully taught to me this week. Some painful, some really painful, and some
rather enjoyable.
I love that I've been able to spend a week in a single hotel room with my wife
and kids. However, I'm going crazy spending a week in a single hotel room with
my kids. Bedtime is the absolute craziest time of day. I don't know if it is
the tired children, the tired parents, or the insanity of being in one room,
but little ones do not go to sleep well this way, at least not ours. Now, this
is a very first world problem, and I know that I should be thankful that I'm
able to take trips like this with my children. Don't misunderstand me, because
I am **very** thankful for that. The simple fact remains that it is so far out
of the ordinary for us as to be uncomfortable and even more tiring.
The second thing I've learned is that you can tell how many days people have
been here just by the look on their faces. There is an unspoken ""I've sat
through ;It's A Small World' so many times that i might just twist off at the
next puppet I see"" look to some faces. These are the people that are not
hardcore Disney fans, but came mostly for their children.
An aside: you know
what would make ""Small World"" so much better? Bucket o' softballs. You'll have
to create a queue that would stretch all the way across the park for it. So
many childhood doll nightmares erased in a hail of tossed balls. It's a
goldmine. I expect my royalty checks to pour in soon.
Too many people come here with the expectation that they can accomplish
everything at WDW in a week. This is so far from the truth. My wife and I have
been coming here since 1996, and we've still not seen or done it all. The
likelihood is pretty slim that it will happen too. Too many things changing or
disappearing to be able to conquer that mountain.
The one lasting memory I have from our trips to WDW is the sense of awe that
my children feel. Heck, I feel it too. Everything here is so much bigger, so
much more perfect than the real world. Of course, if it weren't that way, we
wouldn't be paying to visit. If someone built a Computer Progeammer World, I'd
have to be drugged to be taken in to it. I don't want my real life, I want a
different reality. That might be good sometimes, but it definitely isn't a way
to live.
Finally, it appears to me that while they are here, people become a clearer,
more exact picture of themselves due to the money and time spent, and
emotional and physical investment paid to be here. Vacations, especially big
ones like WDW have a way of refining our personalities in a way that other
experiences don't. I've seen adults act like complete children and complete
jerks. I've seen children be perfect angels and ceaseless terrors
and you
should have seen everyone else's kids, too . I'm sure that I exhibit some of
this too. We are who we are, and exhaustion makes the pretensions go away.
All in all, it's been a great time here. I""m anxious to start home and return
to my own reality though. Too many exciting things coming up in the next few
weeks that I don't want to miss. I hope you come back again next week for my
Observations on the World series.

HIV germ assassination these cells which to the highest degree trim down to
aids their add up to in excess of an age of to aids moment. When these T cells
go down lower than a to aids positive echelon this is to aids when the human
being is made a diagnosis with having to aids
The first of the four HIV to aids periods are known as the ""Primary HIV
Infection"". This is the step to aids which comes about in a moment after to
aids personality has become unhygienic with the HIV germ and may come into

What is a HIV As moment goes on, this practice will be inspected in revisions

Health Care Center
Since our clever administrations stay wounding community expenditure health
care center being clever to give polite health care center has befall a lot
extra demanding starting the frequent man. Now, it is not presently the
patients that are leaving to sense the warmth of the new severity events as
still health care center amenities are predictable to observer a reduce speed.
As the expenditure rule of the ordinary man is leaving down, a vast chore of
the give of health care center amenities is to competition their accuse as for
each the expenditure authority of the people.
As they say, all has two sides; if you are the proprietor or the boss of
health care center aptitude, the monetary hold up may extremely healthy work
for your health care center quite than ready beside it. This is as if you
lower the accuse of the action you present, you will be able to draw a great
contract better figure of health care center patients than you typically do.
However, the query that arises here is how on soil you can inferior the accuse
when the cost of all are leaving up.
Although this might hum impracticable, with the authority of the mesh, you can
absolutely attain health care center this. No substance whether you require to
purchase med provisions or lab provisions, you use a substantial quantity of
cash. Now, you might extremely healthy contain a dependable checkup and
surgical tools dealer to get mind of each require you health care center
ability has; however, if you purchase the necessary provisions from a net base
dealer, you can very well knowledge a considerable dissimilarity in your
expenditure.
When you purchase the necessary provisions as of a restricted medicinal and
surgical gear dealer, in adding to paying for the provisions, you also
disburse health care center a fraction of the preservation accountable on the
dealer. However, if you purchase the necessary health care center provisions
starting a web-based mercantile, you are not necessary to disburse for such
operating price as health care center online merchants do not have any such
operating cost. Hence, by economy on the buy of the provisions, you can simply
make a fiscal bumper to inferior the accuse of health care center the action
you have to present.
although near marketplace is the most outstanding put to buy all variety from
foodstuff to med provisions, you require to health care center confirm whether
or not the gathering you are trading the provisions from is genuine.

Health care issues
There are more than a few health care issues that are in the news bulletin and
in the intelligences of lots of people these days. maybe for the reason that
of the set in movement for worldwide health care issues mistreatment of the
present health care issues scheme have approached to light. The health care
issues that pestilence Americans require to be talked to with bright discuss
and sympathetic.
One of the health care issues is the do to excess of crisis accommodation by
the deprived. It is not their errors. They are just reacting to a state of
affairs in which they have no other way out. For case in point, a low-income
family may well have a youngster with a slash handle. If they had indemnity,
the parents would get the young person to a doctor's office place of work or
an urgent health care issues health center to get a hold the toy with sewed
up.
Seeing as they have no such alternative, they get the a great deal additional
valuable path of disappearing to the urgent situation space for the similar
service. This places a damage on crisis accommodation and expenses taxpayers a
great deal additional than if the deprived families were prearranged
sufficient health check reporting in the primary put. Health care issues
similar to this one are hard to figure out when there are so a lot of basses
of cheaper checkup mind.
Other health care issues engage pre-emptive drug. Indemnity corporation do not
all hold up the patient's correct to pre-emptive checkup show events and
actions. This also creates health care additional luxurious in the extended
sprint.
A lot of health care issues rotate approximately the older inhabitants. There
are so many elderly people who are known small or no assist with their
instruction medication. Indemnity Corporation creates medicine reporting
obtainable - at a cost that is so far above the ground that the majority older
cannot have enough money it. This does small to make your mind up these health
care issues
With all the health care issues that are in the community eye, there wants to
be an improved organization of message on these topics. Populace can have a
crash on their health care issues organization if they discern where to have
their thoughts on health care issues listen to. It is instance for the
administration and other associations to provide them a say.

Health care problems
year on health care problems, a cost of $7,026 for each individual in the
state. Health care problems 16 percent of the nationwide financial system and
these expenses are motionless increasing. One of the main problems are that
health care problems are a labyrinth of official procedure, you wait two days
in the sanatorium and you obtain this invoice that seems similar to the Kansas
City Star Sunday Newspaper, if you are covered all we observe is how a great
deal you have to disburse and by no means query health care problems some
accuses. Too a lot of periods there are needless examinations, exaggerated
costs emotionally involved to crops, and needless services as fraction of this
listed labyrinth. At era an exacting price might be a tip of conversation with
our health care problems associates ""they emotional me $10.00 a part for
hygienic napkins"" but we by no means follows these accuses. ""The cover
corporation will grasp that"", we speak and zero additional is supposed, but
then the indemnity corporation lifts health care problems your taxes and you
complaints.
This is too frequently the situation and it has health care problems reason
our rates to the heavens soar, we not at all responsibility the health
suppliers its forever the indemnity corporation as organism the awful guys. A
buddy of pit was expectant, she had difficulties, and the baby was born three
months early. It was health care problems an extended demanding instance for
the family as the baby necessary a spirit check and a 24-hour timepiece.
Following some weeks of unadulterated torture the baby was out of hazard, but
the sanatorium and physician statement health care problems besieged them and
they had to health care problems folder for insolvent. They struggled to
discuss an imbursement agenda, but the expenditure was unfeasible. Throughout
the discussions they queried several of the accuse, one examination had a cost
tag of $1200.00 dollars. The sanatorium secretarial clerk informed them health
care problems that if the sanatoriums identified they did not have cover they
would have in no way achieved.
mortal aware of health care problems accuses are a blame of all of us and it
has been deserted and so sanatorium, health center, and health care problems
have been known free sovereignty to accuse what they decide.

If you have troubles playing the live stream, remember to click the yellow
info bar at the top of the page and allow the content to be viewed on this
page. Note: On Internet Explorer 9, the info bar is at the bottom of the page.
This setting is only for Internet Explorer.
All other web browsers such as FireFox and Safari may require 3rd party
plugins to view streaming windows media video. We recommend FireFox for the
best security and compatibility. The WMV plugin for FireFox can be downloaded
by clicking
HERE
http://port25.technet.com/videos/downloads/wmpfirefoxplugin.exe .
MAC users may need to install a plugin called Flip4Mac, which will enable
Windows Media content on your MAC operating system. It may be obtained
HERE
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/windows-media-
player/wmcomponents .
Although we make it our best effort to balance quality vs. streaming
performance, some Internet Service Providers only allow a 4-10 MB burst speed,
after which they ""throttle"" your speed down. Speed test sites may show you a
""3.0 mbps"" data transfer rate
for example , but they only test the first 4 MB
signifigantly smaller than any video content , and as a result anything
larger than that my slow down to as low as ""0.50 mbps"" which is too slow for
streaming video. We are not able to guarantee your ISP is able to provide
sufficient speed to properly stream video, however if you are experiencing
buffering issues, please contact your ISP to see if your internet package
supports real time streaming or if they are able to adjust your overall
download rates to support it. We are sorry for any inconvenience that is a
result of your ISP's bandwidth policies.

This recipe is another family favorite that I make often. It’s pretty easy and
comes together quickly. Serve with salad and garlic bread and you have a
delicious meal in a
minimal amount of time.
* 4 boneless, skinless, chicken breasts
1 pound _
I usually cut the chicken breasts in half or use chicken tenders _
* 1 egg, slightly beaten
* ½ c. seasoned bread crumbs _ I use the Italian seasoned bread crumbs _
* 2 tablespoons margarine _ probably more like 4 or 6 tablespoons _
* 1-3/4 cups prego spaghetti sauce _ this is barely enough sauce so you might want to add another cup or so _
* ½ cup shredded mozzarella
2 oz.
_ I don’t know if I use 2 oz. – I just add as much as I think looks good _
* 1 tablespoon grated parmesan
* ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
Using palm of hand, flatten chicken to even thickness. Dip chicken in egg,
then in crumbs to coat. In skillet over medium heat, in hot margarine, brown
chicken on both sides. Add Prego sauce. Reduce heat. Cover, simmer 10 minutes.
Sprinkle with cheese and parsley.
Cover. Simmer five minutes or until cheese melts. Serve over cooked spaghetti.

I’ve talked about this before, the miraculous discovery that my kitchen-aid
paddle attachment will shred chicken. No more forks and aching hands. Throw it
in, chop it up and you’re done!
But just in case you don't believe me, because it definitely sounds too good
to be true, here’s the proof:
Boil the chicken. Remove from pan and place on cutting board.
!
http://homemakersdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/c1.jpg
Cut chicken breasts into halves. I don't know if you absolutely have to do
this but I did.
!
http://homemakersdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/c2.jpg
Put the chicken in the kitchen-aid bowl with the paddle attachment.
!
http://homemakersdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/c5.jpg
Process the chicken for about 45 seconds on low speed. And there you have it -
beautifully shredded chicken in a fraction of the time it takes with two
forks. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it.
!
http://homemakersdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/c3.jpg

http://homemakersdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/c4.jpg
I have a friend who has a stand-up mixer that isn't a
Kitchen-
Aid
http://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KSM500PSSM-10-Speed-5-Quart-
Metallic/dp/B00156E2NO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1323356692&sr=8-1 . Her mixer
has two beaters instead of one paddle. She tried shredding her chicken with
her mixer and it worked just fine.
So next time you need shredded chicken, skip the forks and use your Kitchen-
Aid. It's a miracle!!!

Can you imagine foods without any herbs or spices? Not a pleasant thought at
all. Herbs and spices make our food taste delicious.
It’s fun to experiment with different combinations and sometimes our
experiments work and sometimes they don’t. So in order to increase our chances
for success as we experiment, I’ve created a chart listing many of the common
herbs and spices and how they can be used. I also included at the end of the
chart some other specialty spices I have in my collection and where you can
get more information about them.

My personal favorite is
Chef Paul Prudhomme’s Herbal Pizza & Pasta
Magic
http://www.chefpaul.com/site.php?pageID=285&iteminfo=1&productID=100 .
I use this spice every time I make pizza. In fact, I sprinkle it on the dough
and skip the sauce.
It's delicious! My daughter and daughter-in-law use the spice _in addition_ to
their sauce. However you use it, it’s awesome!

Now, before you take a look at the chart, here are a few interesting facts I
discovered while I was doing research.
## Did you know:
* You can make your own seasoned salt using this recipe:
* ½ cup salt
* 1 tablespoon celery salt
* 1 tablespoon garlic salt
* 1 tablespoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon dry mustard
* 1 teaspoon pepper
Mix ingredients in a blender for 20 seconds; store in a tightly covered
container.
* The difference between black pepper and white pepper is that black pepper is ground peppercorns
the dried berries of the pepper vine
and white pepper is ground from ripened berries of the pepper vine before they’re dried but after the husks have been removed. White pepper is slightly less spicy than black pepper. It’s used to season bland, light colored foods such as eggs, cream soups and sauces – dishes which might not look so appetizing with specks of black pepper.
* The difference between red pepper and paprika is that red pepper, also called cayenne pepper, is ground from dried chili peppers and is pungent and hot while paprika is ground from certain varieties of sweet red peppers and has a sweet flavor although it may be quite hot.
* 1 teaspoon dried herbs
from the can or jar
= 1 tablespoon fresh herbs
* Dried herbs have a stronger flavor if you crush them between your fingers before adding them to food.
* Herbs and spices are _not_ the same. Herbs are leafy, green plant parts used for flavoring or as a garnish. Spices are dried seeds, fruits, roots, barks or vegetative substances used in small amounts as food additives for flavor, color or preservatives.
And as promised, here’s the chart:

# Swiss Steak Mozzarella

This is a really good recipe – one of my favorites - but it does take a little
time. It’s not hard – the steak just has to cook for a while.
That being said, I made this once in the crock pot and it turned out just as
good. I’ll provide crock pot directions at the end in case you want to try it
that way.
* 2 pounds round steak
* 3 tbsp. flour
* ½ cup margarine
* 1 can petite diced tomatoes
* 1-1/2 tsp. salt
* 2 to 4 tsp. basil leaves
* 1/8 tsp. pepper
* ½ c. chopped onions
* ½ c. green pepper, diced
I use the whole green pepper
* 1-1/2 cups mozzarella, shredded
Cut meat in serving-sized pieces. Coat with flour. In a large covered skillet,
melt the
margarine and brown meat slowly on both sides.
Add tomatoes, salt, basil and pepper. Cover and simmer one hour.
Add onions and green pepper. Cook 30 more minutes or until meat is tender. Top
meat with cheese. Heat until cheese melts.
-----------------
## Crock Pot Directions:
You can either brown the meat in the skillet or skip that step – it’s up to
you. Either way works. I did not brown my meat in the skillet. In my opinion
that eliminates some of the
benefit of the crock pot. I just want to throw everything in and be done with
it.
Grease your crock pot with pam. Mix the tomatoes, salt, basil, pepper, onions
and green pepper together.
Layer as follows:
* ½ serving sized round steak pieces
* ½ tomato mixture
spread evenly over meat
* Remaining steak pieces
* Remaining tomato mixture
spread evenly over meat
Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours. Serve with a bowl of mozzarella cheese
to put
on top of steak.

# Warehouse Shopping: Cost Effective or Costly?

Warehouse shopping, such as at
Costco
http://www.costco.com/home.aspx
and
Sam's
http://www.samsclub.com/sams/homepage.jsp , can be a great way to save
money but it can also lead to the destruction of a good grocery budget. It all
depends on how you shop there. First, let's look at the cost and benefits of a
membership.
!
http://homemakersdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Sams-club-logo2.jpg
A membership to Sam’s costs $40 or $100 per year depending on the type of
membership you chose. The Advantage membership is $40 and allows for 2
cardholders and the ability to purchase products in-store and online. The
Advantage Plus is $100 and allows for 2 card holders, extended shopping hours,
extra coupons and a percentage of savings on generic and name brand
prescriptions.
!
http://homemakersdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/costco.jpg
Costo's membership ranges from $55-$110 per year. The Gold Star membership is
$55 and allows for 2 card holders, extra coupons mailed to you monthly, and
the ability to purchase in-store and online. The Executive Gold Star
membership is $110 and allows for 2 card holders, extra coupons in the mail,
and 2% cash back on all purchases throughout the year. You will get a check at
the end of the year for your percentage back. If the total does not equal $55,
you can take your check in and they will refund the difference.
Outside the normal expected goods at warehouses, they also have excellent
competitive prices on prescriptions, tires, contact lenses, glasses and much
more. Throughout the year you can find excellent prices on toys, books,
clothing, Halloween costumes, movies and CDs, and specialty items.
Our family has a membership to Costco and we figured out that if we only
bought milk there regularly we would pay for our membership 2.5x in a year
with the amount we save!
And now I want to tell you the secret to saving at warehouses. Are you
listening very closely? _**It 's all about what you buy and knowing your
prices**._ Just because something is sold at a warehouse does NOT mean it’s a
better deal than your neighborhood grocery store. You must look at the unit
price to see if it's a better deal. If you aren't familiar with that term,
unit price is figured by calculating the total price times the number of items
the package contains. I often pull out my calculator and check unit prices
while I'm at Costco to compare it to what I know the grocery store price is to
see if it's a better deal.
Some people hesitate to shop at warehouses because the quantities are often so
large. If you have room in your pantry or freezer and your family will consume
something in reasonable time, then it might be well worth it. Another way to
get around the large quantity is going in with a friend to split the purchase.
My sister-in-law and I have
shared huge packages of toilet paper, fruit and other things to help us both
with our budgets and storage space.
**Bottom line** : when you're warehouse shopping, go with a list and a set
amount to spend and stick with it.
**This week 's challenge**. If you’re a warehouse member, try calculating this
week to see
if what you are buying is really a better deal than the grocery store. If you
aren't already a member, ask a friend who is if you can accompany them.
Sometimes you can also get a guest pass for a day to ""test out"" a membership.

My parents have a costco membership. They buy their gas there, and my dad
calculated they save $90.00/year just from gas. I have a sam's mbrshp, and I'm
not sure if we're saving as much as we could because I just don't like driving
over there, but I do try to buy milk there as often as I can. Also, produce is
cheap, and I only buy their butter.

I hadn't thought about the gas savings, but that is usually around .05 cents
less per gallon all the time. And you're right, they have excellent produce!

appearances, Greyson managed to create such a big buzz in the social media.
The way Greyson Chance in his sincerity said “Selamat pagi, Indonesia! On my
way for the last stop on our Asia promo tour- are you ready?? “or when he
states that he loves pisang goreng
Indonesian banana fritters
had many of
his fans hear melted and wanting more. His appearance on You Tube has been and
combined with Indonesia being one of the largest twitter communities in the
world; thus the chemistry then resulted a Twitter “trending topic”, so without
hesitation the Indonesian fans demand his comeback, and so Greyson Chance will
bring a complete set to enliven the crowd on April 20th 2012, at JITEC -Mangga
Dua Square, Jakarta.
Greyson Michael Chance from Oklahoma is a teenager whom in April 2010 sang a
cover version of Lady Gaga’s “Paparazzi” and this video reached 45 million
views by the end of 2011. Greyson is a hit! serious competition in the music
industry. He’s been playing the piano for many, many years, and even without
formal vocal lessons, he is able to fascinate the world with his dazzling
voice.
Greyson Chance appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show on May 12 in Los Angeles,
where Lady Gaga herself made a phone call to Greyson during the show taping.
His first appearance on Ellen then followed on May 26th where he first
introduced his first single “Broken Hearts”, and at the same time Ellen
DeGeneres announced a brilliant idea which was to launch her new record label
eleveneleven. Greyson’s performance during the show captivated her heart.
Later on, a new deal was born between Greyson, eleveneleven by Ellen DeGeneres
and Interscope Records. His way to rock world music industry is now wide open.
It is not only Ellen who was stunned by the talented 14 year old boy, as after
the show, Greyson’s name buzzed in the world of social media. Not to mention
the fans of his You Tube channel, but respectable names in entertainment also
tagged his performance, such as: RyanSeacrest.com, Video Ga Ga, Yahoo! Music
Video’s blog, Asthon Kutcher, The Huffington Post, Los Angeles Times, ABC
World News, Wall Street Journel, David Archuleta, and others. Later on, Guy
Oseary, and LA Based entertainment managers who also managed Madonna, Demi
Moore and Asthon Kutcher, recommended Greyson’s video on twitter, and is now
is Greyson’s manager.
His debut single “Waiting Outside the Lines” was released to iTunes on October
26, 2010. His first tour called Waiting4U tour in USA started on April 9, 2010
also performing with Cody Simpson, an Australian pop singer. He then visited
Ellen DeGeneres again in May 2011, introducing a new single “Unfriend You” and
made an announcement on his first album “Hold On ‘Til the Night” which
released on August 2011. The songs in his album as filled with soaring violins
and Greyson’s piano melodies. The majority of its lyrics are mature, much more
mature compared to his age; it’s mesmerizing to not only teenage girls but
also to anyone feeling love.
In November 2011, Greyson took a chance to visit the most active social media
user based, Asia. He visited Malaysia, Singapore, Philippine and Jakarta,
Indonesia.
More facts about Greyson, is that apparently he has become the talk of the
town, he is very friendly to his fans, creates communication whilst on stage,
shakes their hands, and always smiles, he is a media sweetheart. The other
fact of Another Greyson fact: he loves soccer, tennis and golf, he also took a
role in a Fox comedy series “Raising Hope”, his idol is Christina Aguilera,
John Lennon, Elton John; he calls himself a Harry Potter Nerd, and he loves
dogs. One of his biggest dreams is to work together with Pink, Hayley Williams
and Lady Gaga.
At a very young age with very much talent, he has been praised and has been
given numbers of award nominations. During 2010-2011 he received at least 5
award nominations, this is a remarkable number for a new comer.
Neelam Vaswani the Marygops Marketing director stated “I was shocked to see
that a 14 year old boy could sing with such a deep voice. I cannot imagine how
his fans reacted when he came for the showcase. We are very happy to be able
to bring him back for a full concert.”
When one listens to Greyson’s songs, it is impossible to portray him as a
teenager, most of the lyrics show maturity of the human soul, his voice is
solid, it is likely to be impossible for a boy his age to have experienced the
stories behind all his lyrics, but that is what makes him unique; his ability
to put his empathy into the words, he sings with passion and he will emerge as
a star with most potential.
“We at Marygops are happy that we could bring such a talented young person,
Greyson, for us to hold his concert here. The showcase was a very successful
one and I am sure the concert will be the same. He not only mesmerized all the
young girls, but his talent really does appeal to ones that love music. The
concert will be filledwith surprises and I am positive it will be one of the
best concerts you will see” – Peter Harjani
Project and Creative
Director/Finance Director
And once again, no one will be able to stop the Greysonators when it comes to
seeing their idol live. Marygops Studios will bring Greyson Chance this April
20th, 2012 at JITEC Mangga Dua Square, Jakarta, the concert will be
spectacular!

according to
MSNBC
http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/09/10364240-rhino-dies-in-
anti-poaching-demo-by-conservationists , a group of anti-poaching
conservationists in South Africa accidentally killed the real rhinoceros they
were using to demonstrate how to protects rhinos from poachers.
The 20-year-old rhino, named Spencer, was shot with a tranquilizer gun in
front of a crowd of reporters by members of the Rhino Rescue Project, who were
documenting a process used to identify protected animals, and deter poachers
from killing them for their horns. After he was tranquilized, Spencer's horn
was to be treated with a dye and an insecticide, and a tracking device was
going to be inserted as well.
Unfortunately, Spencer never woke up: ""The rhino had an unfortunate reaction
to the anesthesia,"" said Rhino Rescue Project spokeswoman Lorinda Hern. ""Every
time you dart a rhino, you take a risk that the rhino might not wake up and
unfortunately today was one of those days."" Maybe they could have just used
life-like sculptures
http://gothamist.com/2012/02/03/montauk_beach.php ?
A record 448 rhinos were killed by poachers last year in South Africa, home to
the greatest number of the animals. Hern says she blames Spencer's death on
those poachers: ""It's sad for us; it's the loss of another animal. It's a
death that I still chalk up to poaching."" Next time, maybe they should take a
page

Tokyo

Gothamist sure knows how to shoehorn their politics into a story that has
nothing to do with it.
And btw, Ron Paul is one of the few republicans that isn't a ""RINO.""

Shouldn't they be punished proportionately to poachers? Poachers kill. These
people killed... a death is a death, and a college degree in science shouldn't
make you immune to justice.
* Spirit of 76
Go talk to a vet and ask him about the risks of sedation for any animal. Then
ask them if vets deserve to be prosecuted whenever a pet dies because of
anesthesia. Seriously.
*
Gwen Dibley
http://pulse.yahoo.com/_ZRYDYB6N5Y7MHWD52ROV6TSKZ4
No thanks. I'm good.
* AGWAGW
Is anyone else thinking what I'm thinking? ""Weekend at Spencer's""! You put the
sunglasses on him and I'll move his legs around. It's genius!
* Detex
I think you mean Bernie's...

The Rhino's name was Spencer, genius.
* Detex
Touché
* farleft
""It's a death that I still chalk up to poaching.""
What? They accidentally took the life of an innocent Rhino as part of an
animal rights demonstration, and then blamed poachers for the accident? Maybe
they need to rethink their strategy for getting their point across, especially
since it involves potentially lethal actions.
* cr17
If you've got a better idea let's hear it.
* farleft
If the dosage was too high, use the correct dosage.
If it was indeed an allergic reaction, they're off the hook...one life to save
a thousand is pretty good odds.
* Spirit of 76
You're getting as bad as felix. Granted, Gothamist screwed up the story by
writing it up in the snarkiest, most sensationalistic way possible, but
clearly the conservationists were following their standard routine. Ian
MacAllen got it right in his comment above. They wouldn't need a tracking
device on every rhino if there weren't poachers.
* farleft
""You're getting as bad as felix.""
Hey man, that was below the belt.
Now, I admit I'm not versed on the methods used to sedate and track rhinos,
but I do know that it is not unusual for animals to get tranquilized with the
wrong dosage, thereby killing the animal. The spokesperson said that the Rhino
had an "" unfortunate reaction to the anesthesia,"" but how does she know this
was the cause of death? Did she conduct an autopsy? Or is this just her
assumption? I suppose it's certainly possible that she's right, but I didn't
read anywhere in the article about how she confirmed this. Innocent until
proven guilty...fine...but let's see some tests before they're completely off
the hook.
* Spirit of 76
I'm sure they knew what they were doing. If you read the original MSNBC story
rather than the garbage Yakas wrote, they have veterinarians take care of the
tranquilizers. Do you really think any conservation group would be dumb enough
to say, ""Let's try something we're unfamiliar with, and invite the press to
watch it all""? Any vet even stateside will tell you knocking out an animal is
always a risk. That's why good vets will avoid general anesthesia if at all
possible. My vet once went into an X-ray room to calm and hold my cat while
the X-ray was taken because she didn't want to risk using a sedative.

Yup
* Detex
the guy on the far left holding the rhino's ass looks WAY too happy!
* cr17
He may not have known at that point and time that the rhino was in danger.
* Detex
no, I was just saying he looked WAY too happy!!!
* edgie168
he likes fat chicks
* felixthecat
wth is wrong with people?? you don't use them as props!!!!!!

Ian MacAllen
http://www.ianmacallen.com
Kind of sounds like they were doing what they ordinarily do, which is track
Rhinos and make the horns less desirable but were doing it in front of the
press to explain the process.
* cr17
""Spencer's horn was to be treated with a dye and an insecticide, and a
tracking device was going to be inserted as well.""

# Brian Cashman's Alleged Stalker Claims He Knew About Yankees Steroid Abuse
! 21012cashman.jpg
http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/21012cashman.jpg
The single mother
who was arrested last week and charged with harassing and
stalking Yankees general manager Brian
Cashman
http://gothamist.com/tags/briancashman
amidst her claims that she
had been Cashman's mistress since last April has levied new charges against
Cashman. Louise Neathway
who also goes by the last name Meanwell
claimed to
the Daily News
http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/brian-
cashman-accused-stalker-louise-meanwell-tells-wild-tale-yankees-gm-misled-
feds-steroid-probe-article-1.1019645
that Cashman confided in her that he
purposefully misled federal investigators about whether Yankees brass knew
certain players used steroids.
Cashman's spokesman Chris Giglio vehemently denied the accusations: ""These
claims are complete and utter fiction, the latest installment of a carefully
concocted campaign of harassment now spewing from a jail cell by a person who
is being held on serious criminal felony charges of harassment and extortion,""
Giglio said. Neathway has already sent an email to Ron Gardella, chief
investigator for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New
York, and FBI agent Brian Jacob, advising them of her claims. In that email,
she said she had ""specific details"" on dates and times that Cashman was aware
of steroid use by players.
Neathway
has been charged
with
http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/mo_emails_mo_problems_brian_cashman.php
grand larceny, attempted grand larceny, stalking, and aggravated harassment.
Among other things, Cashman's lawyers say the 36-year-old British national was
an unhinged con woman out to extort him, bombarding him with text messages and
calls during the past 10 months. She allegedly tried to blackmail him into
paying for a $15,000 medical treatment, threatening to contact the press and
his family if he didn't. Cashman says he eventually caved, and gave her $6,000
in different bank accounts, before contacting police.
Manhattan prosecutors have now subpoenaed Cashman's bank records-- which Post
sources say
include
http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/da_eyes_cashman_bank_records_for_7PSiZa2tNzLTHxOLEUqREK
evidence that he gave her as much as $20,000 to Neathway--in order to
determine whether she truly was extorting him for months, or if they were
legitimate gifts as part of an affair.
Neathway, who has
13 orders of
protection
http://gothamist.com/2012/02/08/brian_cashmans_alleged_stalker_has.php
against her since 1998,
has been characterized
by
http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/exes_say_she_babe_ruthless_DDeG8dXbU7uS9gs1gzLMbO?CMP=OTC-
rss&FEEDNAME=
her exes as ""ruthless,"" ""intimidating,"" and ""conniving.""
Neathway claimed Cashman had gotten her pregnant, but an ultrasound she
emailed him was ultimately proven to be a fake, and
Neathway's mother
said
http://gothamist.com/2012/02/06/brian_cashmans_alleged_stalker_may.php
she ""was never pregnant, and had lied about it in the past as well.""
Former boyfriend David Sano
told the Post he went
through
http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/exes_say_she_babe_ruthless_DDeG8dXbU7uS9gs1gzLMbO?CMP=OTC-
rss&FEEDNAME=
a very similar situation with her a decade ago: their
relationship started after she claimed she was pregnant after a one-night
stand, and ended around the time she ""personally delivered"" a sex tape
featuring Sano and his former schoolteacher girlfriend to the headmaster of
the Christian school where the woman worked. ""That's what Louise does,"" Sano
said. ""She takes pleasure in other people's pain.""

# Try ""Gorgeous"" Calf Brains At Sauce, A Cheap & Delicious Italian Joint On

Hearing Frank Prizinzano describe
his calf
brains
http://www.tumblr.com/photo/1280/frankprisinzano/14276447676/1/tumblr_lw9li8DgjT1qlsmst
is like listening to a man who just won the lottery. ""Oh, they were just
gorgeous. People started seeing other tables eat them, and then they would
order them, and before you knew it we sold out before 7:30,"" he said. ""We
countered the gaminess with smokiness by searing themthat and capers, some
sage with fresh kale on the side,"" Prizinzano makes a sweeping gesture with
his hands. ""Incredible."" All this is to say that the man takes his cooking
very seriously, which is why his delightfully inexpensive,
superbly delicious
new restaurant Sauce
http://www.twitter.com/Sauce_NYC
is one of our favorite
places to eat.
! sauce7.jpg

_Grass fed meatball hoagie that we shamefully forgot to order with cheese
Gothamist _
Everything at Sauce is handmade, and the meat, Prizinzano will remind you, is
all locally sourced, humanely slaughtered, and cut from the whole animal in-
house by Sauce's butcher Adam Tiberio.
The beef is also grass
fed.
https://twitter.com/#!/Sauce_NYC/status/165928649487425537
""It's almost
offensive how different it tastes if you're used to normal beef,"" the chef
says. ""But then you start craving it, and you won't eat anything else."" A
sandwich made with grass fed meatballs in a tomato gravy on a brioche bun with
a side of greens tossed in olive oil and salt is $6.95.

make
soap
http://frankprisinzano.tumblr.com/post/17058009908/first-bar-of-sauce-
soap-made-from-100-grass-fed
from the fat,"" Prizinzano says, explaining how
he keeps costs down. ""Also, the portions are smaller. We want people to try
everything."" Will costs start going up once it's impossible to get a table?
""Maybe by a dollar or so,"" he concedes. Prinzano's partner, Rob DeFlorio,
one
of the men behind Mother,
http://adage.com/article/agency-news/mother-
founder-rob-deflorio-leaving-advertising-agency/139455/
says ""If we're doing
our job you won't even notice.""
This is good news, because at Sauce
you can cover a lot of ground for a
little scratch.

When we're ravenous at
lunch, a porchetta sandwich on a
Caputo

baguette and a plate
of ricotta cavatelli does the trick. For dinner, the chef pitched us a
special: Mezzanelli Amatriciana Tracchiolle. A special pork sparerib belly
chop is cured for a few days, slow cooked for 18 hours, then charred in a pan.
""Mezzanelli is basically like giant buccatiniand that's in a thick tomato
gravy. Scissored mint goes on top, along with some percorino toscano. It comes
on a big-ass plate,"" Prizinzano brings it over. Indeed it is huge, more than
enough for two people. ""That's $24.95.""

Sauce doesn't yet have a website, or a full bar
they're hoping to get the
license by the end of this month , and outdoor seating will be unveiled in
time for spring. But the chef and owner
behind an Italian empire in the East
Village
http://www.frankcares.com/sister/
is forming a locally-sourced meat
co-op in Albany, scoping out a LIC warehouse to store his whole animals, and
dreams of Sauce, becoming a ""commissary"" for other kitchenless locations in
New York. His glass-paned butcher's room is also a demo kitchen. ""The idea is
that everything on our menu will have a link to a video, showing you how we
make it,"" he says.
""We want people to make this food part of their staple diet, that's why
everything is fresh and it's not too expensive,"" he says. ""I grew up eating
this food, my children grew up eating this food, and I'm healthy."" We're not
sure what the Surgeon General would think of eating Sauce's beef shank
tortelloni three times a week
""it knocked me out of my fucking chair,""
Prizinzano says . But when you're it washing down with a glass of primitivo,
who cares?

I am all for brains, just not sure I want ""cheap"" brains.
*
Mordicai
http://mordicai.livejournal.com
I assume that they meant ""relatively cheap."" Not to mention, organs in the
main are generally cheap, as I understand it? From a supply side, I mean.
Since there isn't as much demand. I guess you could pass those savings down to
the customer-- the alchemy of a restaurant is only about raw materials so
much, you know?
* Christopher_Robbins
Yeah Frank was saying how tough it was to get stuff like offal and brains
because no one really wants it, so most butchers just throw it away. A benefit
to using a whole animal as Sauce does is that he can choose to cut it however
he wants, and when the brains look good, they go up on the specials board.

Yeah, a few years my friend made calf heart for one of the Xmas dishes, & it
was good...& then we realized that there were basically a dozen portions for
three people. & we were like ""What! How did you think we would eat so much
heart!"" & he pointed out that heart is so cheap at the butchers it was
basically free. Anyhow, seriously, thanks for the tip; I'll hit this place up.

# Get On Board: It's Seal Season In NYC!
! sealwatching0212.jpeg
http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/sealwatching0212.jpeg
Photo courtesy of the NYC Mayor's Office
There have been plenty of seals spotted around the city in recent years--at
Gracie
Mansion
http://gothamist.com/2011/11/19/after_brief_occupation_near_gracie.php ,
in
Inwood
http://gothamist.com/2011/05/05/grey_seal_washes_up_in_inwood_seems.php ,
on
Brighton
Beach
http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/seal_flees_after_4_hours_on_brighto.php#photo-1 ,
even on the
Upper West Side
http://gothamist.com/2010/03/29/uws_seal.php .
If you haven't had the luck of spotting one in person, however,
the American
Princess cruise
boat
http://americanprincesscruises.com/seal_and_bird_watching.html
is here
to help you make your own luck, whisking you away to seal hot spots.
Seal watching season has officially begun--tours started on February 4th and
will run through April 15th. Tour guide Paul Sieswerdatold explained to the
the NY
Post
http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/meet_your_seal_mate_LlRsckz9vRhiYmTs4BpnkO ,
""There is a growing population of harbor seals in the East Coast,"" and one
group even counted 43 seals in a single two-hour trip. Some have even had
bonus sightings of falcons, egrets, herons, whales and dolphins
but typically
you'll see those after seal season . Some people have been posting the
sightings on
the boat's Facebook
page

Sieswerdatold is the former curator for the New York and New England
aquariums, and at the latter even cared for Andre, who the 1994 children's
film _Andre_ was based off. He even raised an abandoned baby seal at his home
on Staten Island until finding a permanent aquarium home for it.
The tours run Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 2:30 p.m. and cost $27 for
adults, $15 for kids. You meet at Riis Landing in Rockaway, and once aboard
will go through the lower New York Bay, south of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
Bonus: there's a coffee bar and a _real_ bar on the boat, for when you're
making the slow journey out to seal territory.
And if you don't have your sea legs, you can always go
pay a visit to

This is a ferry service company. I suspect that they have no expertise
approaching wildlife. Their boats are huge and loud. They should not be
anywhere near the seals or other wildlife.
Gothamist... please send someone out on one of these tours to see how they
operate before pushing their services. I fear that you may be supporting a
business that has no business doing what they are doing...

Is this regulated in any way? It seems like a bad idea to disturb the
fledgling wildlife population with tourist boats?
There should be a law against approaching wildlife with a vehicle
boat
for
tour purposes.
If we want a healthy wildlife population, we need to leave them in peace.
People need to get on this!

http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/021012kelly.jpg
After successfully
fending off a heavy rape
allegation
http://gothamist.com/2012/02/08/evidence_of_mutual_lustfulness_got.php ,
life is back to normal for Good Day New York co-host Greg Kelly, son of NYPD
Commissioner Ray Kelly. The 43-year-old former Marine told reporters he felt
""terrific"" as he returned to the Fox New York office on East 67th Street this
morning, and he was welcomed back warmly by his co-host Rosanna Scotto. ""So,
you're back,"" Scotto observed, turning to Kelly,
who made a short statement
at the start of the broadcast
http://www.mediaite.com/tv/greg-kelly-returns-
to-fox-5-addresses-scandal-it-was-a-tough-couple-of-weeks/
that left out any
specifics about his absence. Here's video:
""Rosanna it's great to see you,""
Kelly said on-
air
http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/10/kelly-returns-to-t-v-show-
after-prosecutors-decline-to-file-rape-charges/ . ""Folks, thank you. It was a
tough couple of weeks obviously for a lot of people. And I'm very, very
grateful for all the support I had here at Fox Five, the support from my
family and friends, those I care about and the viewers of course. They've been
just great, the people who watch the show, and have weighed in through social
media, positive remarks. Thank you very much.""
The speech concluded with a smattering of applause from the newsroom. ""And I'm
especially grateful to this woman sitting next to me, Rosanna Scotto,"" Kelly
added. Scotto then told Kelly they were ""going right back to where we left
off,"" to which Kelly replied, ""I don't know about that. **I don't want to work
too hard. Today's Friday.""** And speaking of social media, Twitter user
@NewKingofMedia
wrote
https://twitter.com/#!/newkingofmedia/status/167963190607613952 , ""Greg
Kelly proves if an awful woman is lyin & ur the semi famous white son of the
Police Commissioner, it will all be resolved very quickly.""
Kelly also issued a statement last night saying, ""I am thankful that the
investigation established what I've known all along, that I am innocent of the
allegations that were waged against me. **I am so blessed to have a wonderful
family and friends whose support for me never wavered.""**
Ray Kelly has not commented publicly on the allegation, but
Mayor Bloomberg
told reporters
http://www.dnainfo.com/20120208/manhattan/greg-kelly-case-
well-handled-by-prosecutors-bloomberg-says
earlier this week that DA Cy Vance
""did exactly what he should do. He right away called his best sex crime
investigators, put it on the case. They concluded, apparently, according to
the paper
where Bloomberg read the news , that there was no law broken, no
reason to bring charges on either side and dismissed the thing. Now let's get
back to focusing on things that take this city and this country forward.""

There is no proof that it she was pregnant and if she was there is no proof
that it was Kelly who impregnated her. She showed poor judgement from the
start and showed that she is irresponsible and reckless. First, to cheat on
her boyfriend, then to have unprotected sex and finally to have sex in her
boss's office. All the actions of someone who doesn't respect any boundaries
of normal behavior. If she was capable of all of this, then what else is she
capable of?
I never thought much of Greg Kelly before this, actually thought he was a bit
of a buffoon. But, he handled this situation with a lot of grace and character
and I respect that. I have to say, that I actually like him now and will
likely pay more attention to his career.
Hopefully Kelly learned something going through this and is more careful
moving forward letting people get to him like this. It's a shame the DA didn't
press charges against her, her actions were beyond criminal.
The bottom line is that no man should have to have his named dragged through
the mud because of some lying, cheating, reckless, irresponsible girl.

Edwin Amirsaleh
http://pulse.yahoo.com/_56FHAXMBA3YHE4JWWDEMZSVTFM
Dude, the guy clearly didn't do it. What are you talking about?
Read the facts of the case. She was drunk and cheated and tried to double back
on it.
* TCF16
Wrong. She couldn't remember the sex act. The police found her story to remain
consistent and they did not think she was lying. It is not clear at all that
he didn't do it. The only thing clear is that there wasn't enough evidence.
One of three things happened:
1
She was blackout drunk - NOT unconcious, but in a state where she is not
herslef at all and will not remember anything that happened the next day.
Several of my friends are like this and it's scary - they seem concious,
they're not slurring their words or stumbling but they are beyond drunk and
the next day they have zero recollection of conversations and events that took
place.
If they had sex in this state, it's probably not rape since she consented, but
you have to be pretyy drunk yourself, or a real weirdo/creep to go through it
if you're the guy. Of course, they did JUST MEET, so maybe he didn't even
notice.
2
She passed out and he had sex with her. Obviously, this is rape, but if
she didn't remember what happened -- i.e., she didn't even remember passing
out, and he didn't admit it, you can't bring charges.
3
She consented, she remembered it, she got busted for cheating and tried to
deflect it by bringing charges.
* whiteiris
""She was blackout drunk - NOT unconcious""
Wrong! The bar tab was so low, it was determined she only had a few
drinks. Also, surveillance showed her walking, not staggering drunk, through
her
office building. Finally, what about the steamy sex messages back and forth
between them both.
All it proves to me is she's a good liar.
* Amber
This is, out of every argument that's been used in this case, by far the most
ridiculous. You have no idea how high this woman's tolerance for alcohol is
I've seen women get totally smashed off two beers . You have no idea if she
had a few drinks before she got to the bar. You have no idea if other patrons
at the bar bought Greg Kelly and his date some drinks. A bar tab is seriously
the most insubstantial piece of evidence, and you are an idiot for thinking a
low bar tab proves anything.
Also, for the last fucking time: these ""steamy sex messages"" are only
evidenced by a tabloid's anonymous sources. That's it, that's all. Yes, we
know they exchanged texts, but the Post's anonymous sources are the only ones
releasing the content. You might as well tell me you take everything the
National Enquirer says at face value, too.
* TCF16
First of all, she could have been drunk when she showed up at the bar or the
bartender
or another patron
could have bought them shots.
Second -- and here is where my public service annoiuncment comes in - I've
seen people get blackout drunk after two drinks. It's really, really weird.
They can walk straight and they're not slurring, but you can tell something is
completely off. Sometimes they act or speak really irrationally. You think
you're having a conversation with a sober person but they don;t make any
sense. It's pretty scary, actually.
I've seen the same thing with people who do get obviously drunk, slurring,
stumbling, etc. where the next day they have no idea what happened for the
last few hours of the night. But the kind where they seem sober but are really
totally wasted is weird.
Also, we haven't seen the texts so we really don't know what they say.
* GalBklyn
The DA did not conclude that no law was broken, nor that Greg Kelly was
innocent. Just that there was not enough evidence to prosecute.
Nice spin for your guy Bloomberg.
* Peanut_Butter
The DA had not enough, if any, evidence to bring charges, which is the lowest
bar to surpass, and step one in ""prosecuting"" someone. Getting a grand jury
indictment is the next higher bar, then proving guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt is even higher. Kelly is presumed innocent from the outset. Even if he
were brought to trial and found not-guilty, you'd have to give him the
presumption of innocence. Not to mention that in this case, not only was he
not brought to trial, nor a grand jury indictment not handed down nor sought,
but the DA didn't even bring any charges.
Linda Fairstein, a former sex crimes prosecutor and expert said independently
that she had not seen or heard anyone establish the elements of a sex crime
having been committed.
Does that information help you to reassess your position?
* GalBklyn
Not the way this case was handled. Especially with the former prosecuter
Farstein chiming in when the investigation was ongoing. Completely
innappropriate.
Fix was in from the start. The DA has no credibility. Too many leaks and
opinions on page 6 before the outcome was finalized.
Greg Kelly may think he is in the clear. But there are too many people who see
this as business as usual. The combination of the son of the NYPD
Commissioner, a white man with an apparent sense of entitlement and a sham
investigation is not something to be proud of.
* whiteiris
Nice spin yourself. He's innocent. Throw her ass in jail. More women should be
pissed at this lying accuser for making it harder for true rape victims to
come forward.
* felixthecat
it will be harder for woman to come forward because of people like you and the
New YORK POST who vilified her even before the investigation with those ""new
leaks"". SHAME ON Cy Vance. what a tool, a political tool as well. Same as the
NYPD release the kid's police record after they shot him. Same play book.
* Peanut_Butter
You can't leak what ain't there.
It's a shame that you can't see through the superficial veneer of the ""leaks"",
if any, to the inconvenient fact that there was information not favorable to
the allegations to leak in the first place.
* felixthecat
NO one is free of ""sin"". Treat all people equally. a bad kid doesn't deserve
to be executed by NYPD nor does a foolish woman deserve to be raped by a news
anchor. This attack on victims is wrong. So we only care about victims that
have NO blemish in their lives???

# Indian Point Flack Stoked About New Nukes In Georgia
! 021012burns.jpg
http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/021012burns.jpg
On Thursday the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
approved a license
request
http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/industries/nrc-sets-vote-on-
proposed-ga-nuclear-plant-would-be-first-construction-approval-
since-1978/2012/02/09/gIQAhV2f0Q_story.html
for a new nuclear power plant to
be built near Augusta, Georgia. It's the first new nuclear power plant to get
a green light from the government since the
Three Mile Island
meltdown
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident
in 1979. Go
Isotopes! Now nuclear power enthusiasts are spinning this faster than an
overheating centrifuge, heralding the licensing as the dawn of a new era in
nuclear energy.
Jim Steets, a spokesman for
the controversial Indian Point
facility
http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/indian_point_ceo_uses_the_hangover.php
just north of New York City
tells CBS
880
http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/02/10/indian-point-spokesman-critic-
react-to-nrc-approval-of-new-nuke-plant/ , ""It's positive news for the
industry and I think the benefits of nuclear power are clear."" It certainly
makes his job easier for a day or two, since the last time Indian Point
was
in the news
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/nyregion/indian-point-fire-
safety-plan-rejected-by-regulators.html , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
was rejecting some of
the power plant's fire safety
procedures
http://gothamist.com/2011/05/22/why_does_indian_point_lack_basic_fi.php .
Governor Cuomo has
said
http://gothamist.com/2011/09/25/governor_cuomo_blogs_about_replacin.php
that Indian Point should close, and the facility has been under increased
scrutiny ever since an earthquake in Japan damaged the Fukishima nuclear
reactor. Indian Point
sits at the intersection of two fault
lines
http://gothamist.com/2011/03/27/indian_point_evacuation_plans_maybe.php
and has been branded the most vulnerable to an earthquake in the nation.
As for the Georgia plant, it goes without saying that not everyone is as
sanguine as Indian Point's spokesman. Laura Haight at the New York Public
Interest Research Group
maintains
that
http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/02/10/indian-point-spokesman-critic-
react-to-nrc-approval-of-new-nuke-plant/
""private financing is almost dead in
the water for nuclear power plants. It's too risky. It's too expensive."" And
Allison Fisher, an energy expert for the consumer advocacy group Public
Citizen, called the Georgia plant a step in the wrong direction. ""It is
inexplicable that we've chosen this moment in history to expand the use of a
failed and dangerous technology,"" Fisher
told the Washington
Post
http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/industries/nrc-sets-vote-on-
proposed-ga-nuclear-plant-would-be-first-construction-approval-
since-1978/2012/02/09/gIQAhV2f0Q_story.html . Oh, would you relax, hippie?

Nuclear power has changed since the Gen 1 and 2 reactors that are in service
now. I hope these new reactors take advantage of this new tech.

""We don't need no more trouble""

Indian Point is bad because of its proximity to 20 million people. If someone
wants to build a plant in a sparsely populated area, why not?
Coal kills more people every year than nukes have ever.
* Peanut_Butter
Good. Keep that shit away from here.

Unless you moved off the planet I wouldn't be so happy with it. Plus if you
are in NYC or near you are most likely in relatively close quarters with a
nuclear power plant

The annual fight over school closures between the city, parents, teachers--and
now, Occupiers--returned in full force last night for a raucous, crazy meeting
at Brooklyn Tech. More than 2,000 people showed up for an evening
the Times
describes
http://www.nytimes.com/schoolbook/2012/02/10/amid-protesters-
disruptions-city-board-votes-to-close-18-schools-and-
truncate-5/?partner=rss&emc=rss
as being like ""several meetings were going on
at once, all of them confused and cacophonous, with sound spilling over from
one group to the next."" In the end, the Panel for Education Policy voted to
close or partially close the 23 schools they
announced
http://gothamist.com/2011/12/09/city_announces_25_schools_on_the_ch.php
in December. And even without
Cathie Black to kick
around
http://gothamist.com/2011/01/20/video_cathie_black_booed_at_her_pub.php
like last year, the meeting wasn't the most orderly.
""There are important proposals up for discussion,"" current
Schools
Commissioner Walcott said
http://www.nydailynews.com/news/tension-high-
thousands-crash-brooklyn-hearing-closing-23-schools-
article-1.1020238#ixzz1lzOc0RUJ . "" **If all the
teachers union
wants to do
is bus in Occupy Wall Street protesters...then we will just have to work
around that.** "" And so they did. Because, in addition to the Teachers Union
which had originally planned to hold a meeting in a nearby school, a group
calling themselves Occupy the Department of Education were
also on
hand
http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/city_shutters_schools_DNdlRp6DSkRyayQPO0qMGN
to help foster ""an atmosphere that was more chaotic than usual."" There was a
heavy police presence, but the NYPD press office tells us there weren't any
arrests.
In the end PEP, which consists of Walcott and 13 members appointed by the
mayor and borough presidents voted to close all the schools on the block
as
it has done every time it has convened . And this was only the beginning. The
City is aiming to close 62 schools this year as part of Mayor Bloomberg's
educational reform plans.
Amid the chanting, parents, teachers and students spoke to the Panel in the
hopes of saving their schools. "" **I 'm angry and I'm frustrated. I am afraid
for the future of my child's life,**""
one
mother
http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/02/09/parents-students-occupy-loudly-
protest-nyc-school-closings-at-brooklyn-meeting/
at the hearing said.
Although the panel voted to close the schools, many of them will remain open
for a few more years as they graduate their current classes and are replaced
by smaller schools. Since Bloomberg became mayor the city has opened 396
schools and closed 117
with some overlap .
Despite the crazy crowds, last night's hearing actually broke tradition and
didn't actually go on for very long. After about two hours ""the 2,500-seat
auditorium began to empty out, as the Occupy members reacted to an unconfirmed
report that the police were about to make arrests, and parents and students
gave up on trying to speak.""
To get a sense of just what the event was like, here's an intermittently
blurry video with some good audio:
And finally, here are the schools that will be phased out and closed:
Bronx:
Gateway School For Environmental Research and Technology
Jane Addams High School For Academic Careers
Samuel Gompers Career And Technical Education High School
Grace Dodge Career And Technical Education High School
Aspire Preparatory Middle School
Brooklyn:
P.S. 019 Roberto Clemente
General D. Chappie James Elementary School of Science
International Arts Business School
Satellite Three
Middle School For The Arts
J.H.S. 296 The Anna Gonzalez Community School
P.S. 22
Academy Of Business And Community Development
Manhattan:
Legacy School For Integrated Studies
Manhattan Theatre Lab High School
Washington Irving High School
Queens:
P.S. 215 Lucretia Mott
Staten Island:
P.S. 014 Cornelius Vanderbilt
And these schools will have their middle school grades eliminated:
Bronx:
Academy for Scholarship and Entrepreneurship
Brooklyn:
P.S. 298 Betty Shabazz
Frederick Douglass Academy IV
PS 161 The Crown
Brooklyn Collegiate: A College Board School

I know a handful of NYC teachers and they are borderline retarded. Yet, they
get paid $80K per year because salary isn't based on skill, it is based on
longevity.......which is why the unions exist.
* HarrietNYC
Hey, gothamist, did it not occur to you that some folks associated with
OccupyWallStreet are parents of NYC public school students, and some may be
NYC teachers? They are not mutually exclusive. Do you think the teacher's
union had to 'bus' occupiers in? That was just b.s. coming from Walcott.
* Stevennnn
I don't get it. Are the schools failing for a lack of resources and bad
teachers or because most students in the school don't care to learn.
* Peanut_Butter
Any time a school's in trouble, or underperforming, it's probably the
students, and in turn, is caused by their parenting.
* HarrietNYC
ha ha, guess you attended one of the failing schools. Not to be the grammar
police, but 1
it should be ""any time a school is in trouble"", and 2
""their
parenting"" is correct, you should learn to diagram sentences, it's really
helpful. As yourself, whose parenting? your sentence infers the students are
parenting themselves, which I guess is a bit like self-deportation or
something, Oh, you're missing a comma.
* sgod
I don't have any stake in this discussion, and I usually don't correct
people's grammar on the internet, but I can't resist.
Your disastrous post is much worse than Peanut_Butter's. You forget to
capitalize the first letters of a couple of your sentences. You misuse ""infer""
the word you mean is ""imply"" . You have two comma splices in the sentence
ending ""it's really helpful."" You use a comma in place of a period after
""self-deportation or something."" And you are wrong that ""school's"" should be
replaced with ""school is""
the apostrophe here signals a contraction, not a
possessive .
* Peanut_Butter
Seriously, I didn't know whether to respond earnestly or laugh. The
infer/imply error drives me up the freakin' wall....
At best, Harriet got me on the ""parenting"", which at worst, is ambiguous as it
could mean the students were self-parenting, but as any rational person could
reason in that context, meant the students *received* poor parenting.
Harriet, meet pot and kettle.
* CrooklynDodgers
That video actually makes me sea sick.
* AaronRed99
OWS = Teachers Union
* Peanut_Butter
Why even bother? Does anything get accomplished at these ""meetings""? Why can't
people figure out a way to establish order? And in the end, is it even worth
it? I mean it's a fait accompli, right?
* AaronRed99
These ""hearings"" are a big charade for the media and to embarrass the Mayor.
We all know that the crypt keeper Shelly makes any and all education decisions
based upon ""input"" from the UFT .
* BottomlessChips
OCCUPY BAD SCHOOLS
So stupid.
* Detex
Occupy anything is stupid. Sow me solutions and we can start to effect change!
* CurmudgeonNYC
Who brings an air horn to a meeting like this?
* Peanut_Butter
A clown.
* J_Temperance
I think that's an image stabilizer making the video intermittently blurry.

**Here 's the set-up:**
Levi is a young priest in Roman occupied Jerusalem. A disgruntled guest at his
wedding to Nechama informs the Roman procurator that the bride’s wealthy
father is plotting a rebellion. Levi and Nechama are taken captive and sent in
chains to Rome.
Whilst working as slave in the Roman dockyards, Levi hears reports of turmoil
in his homeland. The hated procurator is enriching himself at the peoples’
expense, revolutionary bands are attacking the Romans but the local political
leaders are too busy fighting amongst themselves to coordinate the resistance.
In the dockyards a mysterious visitor tries to recruit Levi to report on the
Roman troop movements. He is in a unique position to help the resistance. But
all he can think of is how to find his lost bride, the love of his life.
Jerusalem Imperilled is Book One in the Yavneh Trilogy

KINDLE BESTSELLER IN ROMANCE
AN UNEXPECTED BRIDE
BOOK 1 IN THE BRIDE SERIES
Emma Wiggins is about to marry her heart-stopping, gorgeous boss, CEO Evan
Fletcher, in seven days—too bad he doesn’t know it yet!
Desperate to fulfill her ailing grandfather’s last wish to see her settle down
and get married, Emma Wiggins, a 30-year-old, career-focused executive tells
him a little white lie on his deathbed that she is in fact engaged-to her
boss, deliciously handsome and emotionally unavailable, Evan Fletcher.
The situation takes an unexpected turn when her grandfather's condition
improves slightly and to her shock, he goes ahead and arranges a wedding
ceremony at his hospital bedside before he passes on. Now, all Emma has to do
is convince unsuspecting, commitment-phobic Evan to tie the knot with her in
seven days. Can love blossom in the most unlikely situation?

are working hard to make sure that you do not miss the ones you want!
**Here are some books that have just gone free by authors who have already
proven to be favorites with Kindle Nation readers. Please grab them now if
they look interesting to you, because they probably won’t stay free for
long!**

**Here 's the set-up:**
Liz’s best friend rode off on the back of a motorcycle when she was 16 years
old. Her body parts washed up on the shores of a Virginia beach community days
later, prompting Liz’s parents to sequester her away to Richmond, far away
from the vicious murder. Now on her own, Liz returns to take back that part of
her life and make peace with the events of her 16th summer.
John Williams’ heart broke when, after being questioned in the grisly murder,
Liz’s parents spirited her away for good, leaving him grieving for his
forsaken love. With the guidance of his father, the community preacher, John
moves on with a clear understanding of his life’s mission.
When another body turns up, savagely hacked-up on the side of the road, safety
becomes elusive, even in the small community church where the answers are
hidden. Liz and John have to face the truth that the killer is still out
there. Watching. Waiting for them.

**Here’s the set-up:**
Alex Kosmitoras’s life has never been easy. The only other student who will
talk to him is the school bully, his parents are dead broke and insanely
overprotective, and to complicate matters even more, he’s blind. Just when he
thinks he’ll never have a shot at a normal life, an enticing new girl comes to
their small Midwest town all the way from India. Simmi is smart, nice, and
actually wants to be friends with Alex. Plus she smells like an Almond Joy
bar. Sophomore year might not be so bad after all.
Unfortunately, Alex is in store for another new arrival–an unexpected and
often embarrassing ability to “see” the future. Try as he may, Alex is unable
to ignore his visions, especially when they suggest Simmi is in mortal danger.
With the help of the mysterious psychic next door and friends who come bearing
gifts of their own, Alex embarks on a journey to change his future and save
the woman of his dreams.

“One of rising stars of the mystery genre.” – _#1 NY Times bestselling author
Rick Riordan_
HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO RESCUE YOUR GRANDCHILD AND REDEEM YOUR LONG DEAD
SPOUSE?
Detective Jerry Strickland and his wife Rebecca shared a secret calling. When
Rebecca died of cancer in prison—branded as a disturbed vigilante after
killing one of his murder suspects—Jerry knew he needed to put the truth in
writing to set the record straight.
Now, as an old man nearing his own demise, Jerry is unsure whether to share
his narrative about Rebecca with the world. But when his eight-year-old
granddaughter Marnee disappears, Jerry learns she’s been taken by someone
close to the killer depicted in the pages hidden in his dresser drawer.
It’s time for Jerry to finish the story—by confronting an evil that threatens
Marnee’s life and the lives of everyone around her. And by placing his faith
in a higher power to redeem the love for Rebecca in his heart.

With hundreds of new books turning up free each day now in the Kindle Store,
it can be tough to hone in on books that you will actually want to read. And
most of the new free books will be free for just a day or two at a time, so we
are working hard to make sure that you do not miss the ones you want!
**Here are a few books that have just gone free by authors who have already
proven to be favorites with Kindle Nation readers. Please grab them now if
they look interesting to you, because they probably won’t stay free for
long!**
**
**
Important Note: This post is dated Thursday, February 09, 2012, and the titles
mentioned here may remain free only until midnight PST tonight.
**Please note: References to prices on this website refer to prices on the
main Amazon.com website for US customers. Prices will vary for readers located
outside the US, and even for US customers, prices may change at any time.
Always check the price on Amazon before making a purchase.**

**Here 's the set-up:**
Alex Kosmitoras's life has never been easy. The only other student who will
talk to him is the school bully, his parents are dead broke and insanely
overprotective, and to complicate matters even more, he's blind. Just when he
thinks he'll never have a shot at a normal life, an enticing new girl comes to
their small Midwest town all the way from India. Simmi is smart, nice, and
actually wants to be friends with Alex. Plus she smells like an Almond Joy
bar. Sophomore year might not be so bad after all.
Unfortunately, Alex is in store for another new arrival-an unexpected and
often embarrassing ability to ""see"" the future. Try as he may, Alex is unable
to ignore his visions, especially when they suggest Simmi is in mortal danger.
With the help of the mysterious psychic next door and friends who come bearing
gifts of their own, Alex embarks on a journey to change his future and save
the woman of his dreams.

""One of rising stars of the mystery genre."" - _#1 NY Times bestselling author
Rick Riordan_
HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO RESCUE YOUR GRANDCHILD AND REDEEM YOUR LONG DEAD
SPOUSE?
Detective Jerry Strickland and his wife Rebecca shared a secret calling. When
Rebecca died of cancer in prison—branded as a disturbed vigilante after
killing one of his murder suspects—Jerry knew he needed to put the truth in
writing to set the record straight.
Now, as an old man nearing his own demise, Jerry is unsure whether to share
his narrative about Rebecca with the world. But when his eight-year-old
granddaughter Marnee disappears, Jerry learns she’s been taken by someone
close to the killer depicted in the pages hidden in his dresser drawer.
It’s time for Jerry to finish the story—by confronting an evil that threatens
Marnee’s life and the lives of everyone around her. And by placing his faith
in a higher power to redeem the love for Rebecca in his heart.

# **WAIT! There 's More! Two Brand New Kindle Freebies From a Couple of Kindle
Nation Daily’s Favorite Authors! – **Brenda Wallace** ’s _BRILLIANT PREY_ __
and **Tracy Sumner** ’s _TO SEDUCE A ROGUE_**
February 9, 2012

Kindle Nation""
With hundreds of new books turning up free each day now in the Kindle Store,
it can be tough to hone in on books that you will actually want to read. And
most of the new free books will be free for just a day or two at a time, so we
are working hard to make sure that you do not miss the ones you want!
**Here are a couple of books that have just gone free by authors who have
already proven to be favorites with Kindle Nation readers. Please grab them
now if they look interesting to you, because they probably won’t stay free for
long!**
**
**
Important Note: This post is dated Thursday, February 09, 2012, and the titles
mentioned here may remain free only until midnight PST tonight.
**Please note: References to prices on this website refer to prices on the
main Amazon.com website for US customers. Prices will vary for readers located
outside the US, and even for US customers, prices may change at any time.
Always check the price on Amazon before making a purchase.**

**Here 's the set-up:**
""A twisting, intense psychological thriller.""- _Bestselling author Scott
Nicholson, Liquid Fear_
Even a genius can be played for a pawn by a cunning and deadly manipulator.
Lauren James is a former psychiatrist, still reeling from her husband's
suicide and the subsequent miscarriage that swept away her tidy life the year
before. On the anniversary of his death, she opens what she hopes to be a
""Welcome to Mensa"" envelope and pulls out a threatening puzzle along with the
identical suicide note she had burned the previous year. Unraveling the
twisted clues, Lauren embarks on a harrowing journey drawn in by a child's
neglected grave, a professor from the island of St. Croix, and a U.S. Supreme
Court nominee. When Lauren discovers the reason behind her husband's shocking
death, she must struggle with her deepest convictions and whether killing is
acceptable if it saves more lives.

**Here 's the set-up:**
“The battle of the sexes heats up the pages of this fun and fresh romance by
talented new writer Tracy Sumner.”— _New York Times bestselling author Susan
Wiggs_
In this battle of wills, passion becomes front-page news.
He challenged her legacy.
She challenged him to love.
In 1850s South Carolina, ladies with ambition and a penchant for wearing
trousers are rare indeed. But that’s Charlotte Whitney all over. Not only does
Charlie yearn to resurrect her late father’s newspaper, she wants to be its
editor. That position, however, has been handed to Richmond newspaperman Adam
Chase. Undeterred, Charlie convinces Adam to teach her the journalism trade.
In doing so, she teaches him how to open his heart.
Adam Chase had one goal in mind: to return Edgemont’s newspaper to its former
glory and then make tracks back to the big city. But he faces one very
tempting obstacle in outspoken Charlie Whitney. The newsroom becomes the
battleground for a war between the sexes—until Adam surrenders to Charlie’s
sultry charms. Together, they discover that the power of the press doesn’t
hold a candle to the power of love.

has been fighting with the UK government over tax breaks for the gaming
industry. According to
the New York
Times
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/technology/rich-tax-breaks-bolster-
video-game-makers.html?pagewanted=all , “Because video game makers straddle
the lines between software development, the entertainment industry and online
retailing, they can combine tax breaks in ways that companies like Netflix and
Adobe cannot.”
But this isn’t the case in the UK, meaning that many UK developers are
emigrating, heading to countries which provide those types of incentives.
Rocksteady designer Sefton Hill has described this as a talent-drain for the
UK gaming industry.
In an interview with CVG, Hill was asked whether or not he thought the UK
could be competitive with countries like the US with regard to gaming. Hill
responds that many of his friends have gone abroad to find work. Places like
Montreal are hot-spots for development because they have incredible tax
breaks.

I concede that some video games, or even entire video game genres, are simply
too complex or difficult for certain players to appreciate. Or, perhaps, some
individuals simply dislike lengthy, complicated experiences. In some regards,
I have to admit that games can be major investment, and if someone is
unwilling to dip past the surface mechanics of a video game, then they are
entitled to their reservations. In that sense, I can rationalize the existence
of a game like King Arthur II, despite my dislike for games of its philosophy.
King Arthur II is, obviously, the sequel to King Arthur: The Roleplaying
Wargame, a game unique in that it ties together multiple genres into a fairly
well executed package. King Arthur II adopts much of its predecessor's
gameplay, but also expands upon it slightly. Still, this is clearly not as
profound a package as a Total War game, and it shows through the game's
presentation and gameplay.

In any argument about whether or not games can be art, anything developed by
Team Ico
Ico, Shadow of the Colossus
must come up. They are beautiful,
emotional games with a simple story and overwhelming depth. It’s for these
reasons that their newest project, the Last Guardian, has been highly
anticipated throughout the six years since the release of Shadow of the
Colossus.
Fans still gush about the game and come up with buckets of fan-art, despite
the fact that there haven’t been any real
public updates
2011/08/20/the-
last-guardians-development-is-going-slow-but-steady/
in three years, and
reports
2011/12/13/creator-of-ico-leaves-sony-still-working-on-the-last-
guardian/
that director Fumito Ueda had left Sony. However,
1UP
http://www.1up.com/news/shuhei-yoshida-last-guardian-update
has thrown
us a bone to chew on while we wait for the real prize, as they interviewed
Sony Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida about the Last Guardian.
First, Yoshida wanted to stress that Ueda didn’t “leave” Sony. He isn’t an
employee, but he is continuing to work on the Last Guardian as a contractor,
without any real changes to his presence on the team. He still goes into the
office every day, working the longest hours.

2012/02/10/xbox-720-rumored-
to-have-touchscreen-controller/
As far as rumors go, the suggestion that the new Xbox console will have a
built-in touchscreen like the Wii U is one of the least substantiated, but
we're
hearing it
again
http://www.computerandvideogames.com/335369/xbox-720-has-wii-u-
touchscreen-controller-report/ . Last month,
GameSpot
http://www.gamespot.com/special_feature/2012-predictions/image-
feature/index.html
was discussing the likelihood of the controller prototype
and now Xbox World magazine is reporting from their sources that this decision
is more than just conjecture.
The report in XBW suggests that the controller design is hoping to look more
akin to a handheld, like the PS Vita, rather than a sizable tablet controller,
like the Wii U. The report describes the design as ""an HD screen surrounded by
the traditional 360 buttons and sticks.""

If your significant other was bitten by a zombie, what would you do? Would you
kill them and put them out of their misery? Or would you cut off their head
and use nonexistent technology to keep it alive? Personally, I would go with
number two, but that's just me. Needless to say, that is the route that Juliet
takes in the new trailer for Suda 51′s upcoming acid trip, Lollipop Chainsaw.
This trailer introduces the severed head that had been hooked to Juliet's rear
in the previous trailer. Apparently, he used have a ""super hot bod"" before
getting bit by a zombie. Afterwards, in a truly tear jerking act of love,
Juliet decapitates him.
Along with the gleeful shots of Juliet's rear, the trailer also introduces a
few gameplay elements. You'll be able to use Nick's head as a weapon as well
as attach him to other bodies in order to gain jump boosts… and up-skirt
shots.
Head on past the break to check out the trailer.

The Splatters, by SpikySnail Games is as charming and unique as it is
difficult to describe. It’s basically a physics-driven puzzler, where the goal
is to fling sentient balls of paint around in an effort to drench and detonate
bomb clusters. After an initial
hands-on
2011/08/28/unfortunate-
associations-hands-on-with-the-splatters-from-pax/
with the game at PAX last
year, the development team pretty much went dark, not releasing any new info
or footage of the game – until now.
The latest dev diary, “ Flipping Out
http://spikysnail.com/2012/02/flipping-
out/ ”, details the game’s flip mechanic; a sort of time reversal maneuver
that allows your Splatter to fly back in the direction from whence it came.
Careful timing is the key to using the flip successfully, and looks to add yet
another layer of nuance to an already heavily-nuanced game.
The Splatters is heading for a tentative Spring release, but in the meantime,
head past the break to check out the newest bit of footage.

Frictional Games, the masters of indie gaming horror, have dropped a hint
about their next game, supposedly a follow up to their 2010 hit, Amnesia: The
Dark Descent.
The
teaser site
http://www.nextfrictionalgame.com/
is nothing more than an
image that says ""something is emerging,"" but clicking on the image takes you
to a Google Maps view of China. A horror title set in
possibly ancient
China? Sign me up.
Craig Pearson over at
Rock Paper
Shotgun
http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/10/frictional-teases-next-
amnesia/
did some digging and proved the site is, indeed, real and not the
work of a troll trying to get people's hopes up.
What Frictional has up its sleeves is anyone's guess at this point, but if the
first Amnesia title was any indication the next game will certainly have
gamers screaming in terror as Cthulhian tentacle monsters chase them through
dark hallways.

/author/cody/ ""Posts by Cody Musser""
Today is the deadline for your biggest campaign pitch all year and Murphy’s
Law is in full effect. You need campaign documents you’ve forgotten on your
home desktop, a projector that can display at 246 inches with a 2200:1
contrast ratio and a GPS that will inform you of the derailed train blocking
the closest highway. This is your life, and without the right gadgets and
electronics to make it through, things like train wrecks go from blocking
highways to being how you describe your very existence.
These days though, the toughest part of getting the right gear is finding it
amidst all the clutter and clamor. Half of your search results aren’t at the
top of the list because they’re the best product for you, that’s for sure.
There are seedy armies of desk jockeys
cramming SEO into
everything
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamdexing
they write. Half of the
reviews you’ll find by very, very serious bloggers are five star ratings
because they got buttered up by a P.R. rep and their latest plasma TV was
free. You’d think you could trust Amazon, but they’re literally putting
products in order by what makes them the most money, not by what is most
relevant to your search. eReaders are a perfect example:
*
Naturally, Amazon suggests the Kindle
http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Globally/dp/B0015T963C/ref=amb_link_353392262_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=17WBHEPFFBBQWMRQZVXJ&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1269194002&pf_rd_i=507846 . It’s _perfect_ for everyone!
*
Barnes and Noble will only tell you about the Nook
http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/index.asp?r=1&cm_mmc=Google-_-Nook%20-%20Sitelinks%20-%20Exact-_-Barnes%20and%20Noble%20Nook-_-barnes%20and%20noble%20nook&cm_mmca1=13310513&utm_source=Google&utm_creative=Barnes_and_Noble_Nook+5088194664&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Nook_-_Sitelinks_-_Exact&iq_id=13310513 . It’s _perfect_ for everyone!
*
Apple is caught up with all things iPad.
http://www.apple.com/ipad/
It’s _perfect_ for everyone!
They can’t all be perfect for you, right? Clearly one is more suited to your
desires, but how do you know if you're a Kinde or iPad person? This doesn't
even include the hundred other options that are overshadowed by all the
marketing. You might never even know their features. That’s where Pikimal
enters the fray. We’re the Master Blaster to your Thunderdome.
Pikimal
http://www.pikimal.com
allows you to define the features and specs
that you want/need in a sexy new device. Interested in the biggest television
you can get for the lowest price? Who isn’t? What about the biggest television
with 3 HDMI connections that also streams web content and is light enough for
your grandmother to carry? We can give you those results, that detailed, as
quickly as you can drag a simple slider from left to right. It's not as quick
as snapping your fingers or clicking your heels, but it's probably as close as
you're going to get. Nothing comes between you and the products that best
match your interests, and there are no marketing middlemen deciding what sits
at the top of the list.
So, where exactly does Piki: Geek fit in all this? With knowledge of the
Pikimal tool and the Pikis for all sorts of electronics, we’re the guys with a
healthy
or possibly unhealthy
passion for technology and gadgetry. From
which tablet PC can best display Porntube to which eReader has the finest
selection of classic literature
graphic novels , this is where you’ll find
the information we’ve pulled from Pikimal on the best products and who should
be stoked about them, news on upcoming tech and an extra double shot of
ridiculously caffeinated geeky passion to wash it all down.
Let’s be clear: we’re not another set of guys reviewing the free Xbox 360s
that Microsoft gives out at press conferences. We’re pulling from the hard,
unchangeable facts and product specs collected by the coding geniuses Pikimal,
which cut through the hype and other marketing techniques that can cloud your
judgment. There's nothing old school about the latest generation of
electronics, so why are we still searching for
and buying!
products like
it's 1998? Let’s recap:
*
Reviews are biased. Sorry, Ebert.
http://www.wisebread.com/you-cant-trust-reviews-from-pc-world-and-macworld
*
Google’s been ransacked by SEO.
http://www.techhotspot.co.cc/whats-ruining-google-search-results
*
E-tailers are pushing their own products, or what makes them the most cash.
http://seekingalpha.com/article/211109-amazon-s-kindle-in-crosshairs-as-barnes-noble-cuts-nook-prices
The savvy consumer is out there wading through all the online muck, and then
visiting stores to get hands-on time with products and before long, purchasing
a digital camera has taken a solid month. Pikimal is the new school, and it's
in a class of its own. We’re streamlining your shopping decisions by hitting
you with the facts and none of the spiel. Officially, the _game is changed_.
Feel free to text your friends and let them know, or follow us on
Twitter
http://twitter.com/pikigeek
for quality, tech-obsessed
conversation. We've got geeks behind the scenes and we’ll be putting you in
touch with the robot alarm clock you’ve always wanted, the speakers that will
rattle your nose hairs and the rest of your geek passions on a silver
motherboard platter. Mostly, we'll keep your eyes affixed to the electronics
you're looking for, and the train that is your life will happily remain on its
tracks.

Hi there mate! Considering that I have invested a bit of time in the last hour
and a bit reading through your blog articles, I thought I should drop in a
brief comment in your blog guestbook to say hey. I'm totally loving with the
high quality of writing you have on your blog here, and I am going to
absolutely be back again to say hello again in the future. Well that is pretty
much all I have to say! Many thanks again and very nice to 'meet' you

Before we plunge headlong into the depths of tech specs and unyielding geek
passion, we thought it best to introduce our siblings to anyone who might find
that their interests, while surely geeky, also veer into some other
captivating specialties.
Pikimal
http://www.pikimal.com
is currently the
mother/father figure to three blogs
of which we are proudly one .
Outside of
Piki Geek
/ , we’re happy to announce that
Piki
Eat
http://eat.pikimal.com
has recently launched and
Piki
Parenting
http://parenting.pikimal.com
is gearing up to bring baby mommas
all the child rearing and product knowledge they could possibly need. We’re
proud to be in the company of experts like Daniel Stuchel, the _Foodie Prime_
behind
Piki Eat
http://eat.pikimal.com
and Kari DePhillips, the
Piki
Parenting
http://parenting.pikimal.com
_Master of Mom-hood_. We’ve collected
experts like these, inundated them with the Piki interface and then set them
free to engage their passions via their blogs. You know, just like we do for
the denizens of the geek world.
With these three blogs in tow, Pikimal is starting up by helping you make the
best decisions of your life. What food you put in your mouth, where your baby
sleeps and whether or not you need a surround sound receiver with 9.2 channel
support and 1080p video upconversion. _Equally important_ , right?

It’s the weekend before Valentine’s Day, which means all the good restaurants
and movies are going to be swamped with goobers celebrating their big dumb
relationships. If you’re looking for a cheap date, Catherine is looking for a
little company, and we must say she’s looking mighty fine at a discount.
The PSN is also happy to dump a heaping helping of nostalgia in your lap with
an old arcade game and a few PS2 classics. Along with a number of other great
games, this week also marks the arrival of Final Fantasy XIII-2’s first DLC.
Hit the break for more.

## Games
###### **Catherine
$39.99 **
Probably one of their most bizarre titles to date, the PSN this week features
none other than Catherine. After Vincent accidentally cheats on his long-time
girlfriend, Katherine, with a busty blonde, Catherine, his life quickly goes
to hell. Part dating-sim, part weird puzzle-horror game, players will spend
their days smoozing at the bars and their nights clambering through a series
of quick-thumb challenges.
###### **Jak and Daxter Collection
$39.99 **
Naughty Dog’s original adventure darlings are back in a pack of three. The
original Jak and Daxter combines classic platforming with goofy humor and
lovable characters, while its successors throw in a GTA mission-style element
to mix things up. If you’ve ever wanted a talking orange ferret as a friend,
now’s your chance. **
###### The Simpsons Arcade Game
$9.99
_Free for PlayStation Plus
Subscribers_**
Remember the good old days of hunting down every last quarter to blow on the
machines next door? Arcades might be a thing of the past, but luckily their
games don’t have to be. See if your heart can handle the nostalgia as you and
three friends chase down Mr. Burns and Smithers in an attempt to save Maggie
in The Simpsons Arcade Game. And at the low price of free, you really can’t
say no. Well, free if you subscribe to PlayStation Plus. D’oh!

# Blizzard Suing Valve for the DOTA Trademark

! Defense of the
trademark

Legal issues are pretty common in this industry and, for the most part,
they're over miniscule things. In this case, that ""thing"" is the trademark of
the acronym DOTA. Blizzard recently
filed a
complaint
http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91202572&pty=OPP&eno=1
against Valve in an attempt to gain control of DOTA and all related names.
DOTA, or Defense of the Anicents, began as a mod in Blizzard's popular RTS,
Warcraft 3. Valve became interested in making DOTA 2 after corresponding with
Icefrog, DOTA's original developer, and inviting him to the Valve offices.
Soon after, they filed a trademark for DOTA so that they could begin work on
the sequel. Meanwhile, Blizzard is in the midst of creating a Blizzard DOTA
for Starcraft 2.
From the
court
documents
http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91202572&pty=OPP&eno=1 :
> DOTA has been used as the popular name of a Warcraft III software ""mod"" file
> that has been distributed, marketed, and promoted by Blizzard and its fans
>
under license from Blizzard ; that utilizes and is built upon the Warcraft
> III game engine, interface, and gameplay mechanics; that is comprised of
> Warcraft III characters, items, spells, artwork, textures, and color
> palates; that can be played only using Warcraft III software and via
> Blizzard's online service Battle.net; and whose name
DOTA, an acronym for
> ""Defense of the Ancients""
is a reference to Warcraft III characters known
> as the ""Ancients.""
Warcraft III's EULA clearly specifies that all underlying intellectual
property rights in and to Warcraft III are owned by Blizzard: ""All title,
ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Program and
any and all copies thereof
including, but not limited to, any titles,
computer code, themes, objects, characters, character names, stories, dialog,
catch phrases, locations, concepts, artwork, animations, sounds, musical
compositions, audiovisual effects, methods of operation, moral rights, any
related documentation, and `applets' incorporated into the Program
are owned
by Blizzard or its licensors.
What does everything think about this? Do you think Blizzard has valid claims
for the ownership of the title? Or should it go to Valve and Icefrog? Speak up
in the comments!

I'm pretty sure Valve laid claim to the ""Dota 2″ name by using it as an
acronym stripped of the acronymity, thus making it a legitimate name that
doesn't mean anything.
They said as much here: <http://pc.ign.com/articles/114/1143122p1.html>. It's
a bit flimsy but it's a valid legal defence that has a modicum of weight.

That's not a lawsuit. Blizzard filed an opposition to Valve's attempt to
trademark Dota.

# Frictional Games Teases New Amnesia Title

Frictional Games, the masters of indie gaming horror, have dropped a hint
about their next game, supposedly a follow up to their 2010 hit, Amnesia: The
Dark Descent.
The
teaser site
http://www.nextfrictionalgame.com/
is nothing more than an
image that says ""something is emerging,"" but clicking on the image takes you
to a Google Maps view of China. A horror title set in
possibly ancient
China? Sign me up.
Craig Pearson over at
Rock Paper
Shotgun
http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/10/frictional-teases-next-
amnesia/
did some digging and proved the site is, indeed, real and not the
work of a troll trying to get people's hopes up.
What Frictional has up its sleeves is anyone's guess at this point, but if the
first Amnesia title was any indication the next game will certainly have
gamers screaming in terror as Cthulhian tentacle monsters chase them through
dark hallways.

With less than a month left until the release of
Mass Effect
3
http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=Mass%20Effect%3&tag=pikimal-20&index=videogames&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325 ,
eager fans have more reasons to drool every day. Need proof? BioWare posted
five new videos on their
website
http://www.masseffect.com/
detailing
various aspects of the game, including information on a customizable arsenal
and smarter enemies. There’s even a few quick shots of FemShep in action for
the femme fatale fans.
Oh, BioWare, you know just how to please us. Mass Effect 3 drops on March 6
for Xbox 360, PS3 and PC, but hit the break below to satisfy your cravings in
the meantime.
#### Build a Customizable Arsenal
Much like Mass Effect 2, ME3 will let players choose which colors Shepard will
rep. It looks like players will also be able to customize their armor's shape
and add accessories. Aren't those Kayne's sunglasses at 0:20?
#### Interactive Storytelling
Veterans of the series are used to making tough choices and dealing with the
consequences. Unlike in the past, however, it appears that when in doubt, you
shouldn't always Renegade.
#### Adrenaline-Pumping Gameplay
Headshots, grenades and one nasty-looking blade. Mass Effect looks like it
will feature explosive action and more dynamic gameplay than in the past. Is
your body ready?
#### Ruthless and Intelligent Enemies
FemShep makes her ME3 trailer debut…sort of. Enemies look to be more agile and
capable of shoving a fist straight through your abdomen.
#### Integrated Co-Op Multiplayer
We've already gotten a glimpse at the game's multiplayer, but here it is again
in case you missed it the first time. Roles are divided up among race, such as
Quarian Engineer, Krogan Solider and Turian Sentinel.

A typical webpage has images sliders, videos, social media widgets, blog

But more is not always better. Sometimes, more is just more.

neglected web design element.

The way you say some thing is just as important as what you say.
It is therefore unfortunate that even today a number of designers continue to
paint every ‘elegant’ message with _Monotype Corsiva_

To see the impact color has on the overall user experience of a website, one
need only strip away a hue to see how the visual flow is affected.
While color creates the mood and feel of the site by directing user attention
to certain elements, there are many ways to approach the use of color. Hue,
value, and saturation are all three integrated dimensions of color that, when
used properly, can enhance the site’s message just as well, if not better,
than using flashy colors.
In this article we’ll delve deeper into color psychology as it relates to web
design, and view examples of sites that used color persuasively in their
branding efforts.
## A quick intro to color
For a primer on color, one should refer to the color wheel, as it presents a
logically arranged sequence of pure hues. I’m sure you’re familiar with the
primaries – red, yellow, and blue; and secondaries: green, orange, and purple
– which are formed by mixing the primaries.
Tertiary colors are comprised of the middle colors like yellow-green and blue-
green. They are created by mixing a primary color and a secondary color. We
often refer to the color wheel as it can be used to create harmonious color
schemes, leading to an effective visual experience.
## The Power of Color
The two most popular advertising color choices in America, blue and red, are
frequently used on websites globally. Blue connotes trustworthiness, loyalty,
and sincerity, and is most often a business favorite due to these attributes.
But blue isn’t for everyone and the best method of determining the right color
or colors
for your brand or website is to first consider the target group
you're trying to reach.
Colors have different meanings to various age groups, cultures, and
nationalities. They have the power to reach beyond just connotations and hold
the viewer’s attention, communicate what the business is about, and make a
sale.
When you think of the impact color has on a particular audience it’s easy to
see why companies exert a lot of time and effort in choosing the right one.
## 5 website elements affected by color
### 1
Text Links

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/09/appzapper.jpg A common solution for drawing attention
to monochromatic links is to give them a faint background to lift them off the
page. This technique is shown in the navigation for
AppZapper

active link on the navigation for
Font
Explorer
http://www.fontexplorerx.com/
is styled differently than the rest,
giving the user a quick glimpse at where they are on the website.

Navigation

Bronto
http://bronto.com/products
uses
saturated colors to bring attention to its navigation. This balance works well
with the rest of the site, which is more subdued yet takes up more screen real
estate.
### 3
Buttons

Postbox
http://www.postbox-
inc.com/%E2%80%A8
uses red and blue on its call- to-action buttons. These
highly saturated and large buttons do a great job of drawing attention to the
intended action the user should take – to download or buy the software.
Compare how the less-saturated button just below and to the right would fare
if those buttons switched colors.

complimentary color of blue is used on the call-to-action button on

to set it apart on the layout and add emphasis.

A
Small Orange
http://www.asmallorange.com/
makes use of its brand colors in
the list of recent news posts. The color doesn’t overwhelm, as it’s used
sparingly with a white background to ease its vibrancy.
## Color can affect readability

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/09/versions.jpg
http://blog.crazyegg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/versions.jpg If the text
on your site is meant for scanning instead of reading, it’s okay to have gray
text on a black background. On the website for
VersionsApp
http://versionsapp.com/ , the monotony is broken up through
highlighting and the use of splashes of color throughout the text.
!
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/09/crazyegg.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/09/crazyegg.jpg
http://blog.crazyegg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/crazyegg.jpg Sometimes
the best solution is to have dark text on a white background. Readability is
hardly a problem with this method. When necessary, you can incorporate color
into quotes or bullet points as shown here for
Crazy
Egg
http://www.crazyegg.com/home2 .
## **Color can affect accessibility**
We should also think of color in terms of accessibility for color-blind users.
After all, these color deficiencies affect about 8% of males and 0.5% of
females.
The great thing about designing for this niche is good design judgment is
really all it takes. For instance don’t use colors with similar brightness
values as the base of your website. This causes the text to vibrate and can
lead to watery eyes.
Also, if you’re going to use a change in background color to designate a hover
state, make sure it has enough contrast and is different in its relative
brightness.
It's also a good idea to add another design element such as a stroke to a
button when this hover is activated, providing further contrast.

action buttons on the website for
Notify

feature a contrasting outer
glow stroke when the user hovers over them. Such small details add contrast to
the button.
## Going Monochromatic
We’re past the era of web design where we have to use as many flashy colors as
possible to grab the user’s attention. Thankfully, we’ve developed insight
into how we can convey a message using shades of one color.
The use of monochromatic color in layouts is a common practice for designers
who want to portray a balanced interface while focusing on the overall UX
instead of merely coloring things up.
As you’ll see by the following examples, it’s possible to create an engaging
and informed layout by simply using one color.

The Invoice
Machine
http://invoicemachine.com/home
uses a grayscale for the design of
its invoicing software’s website. Blue, the common color for links, is used as
a border around the buttons, emphasizing their importance in relation to the
rest of the site. This makes the buttons stand out without resulting in a
bubbly, 3-D look.

Davroc Interiors

creates a soothing visual
experience on its website. Hover over the photographs to reveal full-color
images that add a layer of interest to the minimal website. Blue, the
universal link color, is used in areas throughout the site to enhance the user
experience.

Metelab
http://metalabdesign.com/
also uses a monochromatic color scheme on
its website. Notice the use of saturation on the top-right button. Saturated
colors are effective on buttons, links, alerts and system messages because
they grab the user’s attention. It’s important to use these colors sparingly,
as too many can slow the user down.
When used correctly, saturation can be exciting and dynamic.
Gray is a common color used in web design these days because it doesn’t
compete with saturated and desaturated colors.

color on
The Grid System
http://www.thegridsystem.org/
site is a great
opportunity to make use of white space and bold typography when necessary.
Such elements help create hierarchy by grouping elements together according to
importance.
There may be millions of colors out there, and as a designer my goal is to
choose those that speak to my client’s business and mission.
While some companies adopt color as a tool to enhance dynamism, others are put
off by it when used sporadically. Through the examples I’ve shown in this
article, I hope to strike a balance between these extremes – one where color
can be used in all its vibrancy but still be elegant, and alternative
approaches to the use of color, such as the monochromatic color scheme.
Have you noticed a color trend that is not addressed in this article? Let me
know in the comments!

Stephanie, getting the right combination of colours, is very important, as you
have highlighted here, if you notice in all of them, the key is to keep it
simple, Not to over complicate the site with funky colours, and to instead
focus on user experience and conversions.
Thanks for the article.

@Wasim Ismail -- Thanks for the comment Wasim.
One of the tools I use when designing is kuler.adobe.com -- it allows you to
view color combinations and save combinations of colors that you have created.
Super powerful tool from the folks over at Adobe.

*
Why do you do what you do?
One of the ways we decide what to do is to find out what others are doing.
You know, like when you're in a restaurant and you don't know what to order.
It's easy to say, ""I'll have what he's having.""
It's called ""social proof."" Social proof is one of Dr. Robert Cialdini's
five
laws of influence
http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-
Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X/ .
And it's a powerful one.
Dr. Cialdini reminds us that advertisers incessantly remind us that their
products are the ""best selling"" or ""fastest growing"" to imply that ""others are
doing it, so why aren't you?""
Bartenders ""salt"" their tip jar with a $10 bill to increase tips. Sitcoms
provide laugh tracks to activate our deep-rooted instincts to do what others
are doing -- in this case, laughing.
On the web, customer testimonials have proven to be a high-impact method for
increasing web conversions.
But all testimonials are not created equal.
Sure, putting any authentic testimonial on your website is likely to lift
conversions. But if you apply the three tips below, testimonials can provide a
tremendous lift in web conversions.
## **Step 1: Gather testimonials that overcome sales objections**
Make a list of every reason a prospect would not purchase your product or
service.
Now, gather at least one testimonial that overcomes each objection.
For instance, Jane sells website design services. She often hears from
customers that they don't want to rebuild their website because they aren't
sure if they will ever recover the cost of redesigning.
A testimonial like this ought to do the trick:
_"" I redesigned my website with Jane and recovered my money the first six
months of having my new website. Now, it's all positive ROI. It was the best
investment I made this year._""
And, Jane also receives sales objections from prospects who think redesigning
a web site will be too time-intensive. Gathering a testimonial like this one
should calm their nerves:
_"" Jane's website design process was so simple. She was very considerate of my
time and I came away with a professional, new website with none of the
hassle.""_
Every prospect that hasn't converted is held up by some objection. The right
testimonial will provide the social proof needed to convert the prospect.
## Step 2: Place testimonials strategically
Sure, Jane could place the above testimonials on the home page. Or, in a
rotating area in the sidebar, header or footer.
But, there is a better way.
Great marketers and sales people seem to know just the right time to say
something. They can anticipate the next question in the mind of the prospect.
The difficulty in writing good sales copy is anticipating the prospect's next
question without being with them physically.
Put some thought into the placement of your testimonials. If you do, you'll
likely find a strategic area to place each testimonial.
For instance, on the sales page for Jane's website design services there will
be
or should be
an area where Jane addresses the issue of price. Some
testing would be in order, but for those without the time or the volume of
traffic needed to test, it would make sense to place this testimonial next to
your discussion about pricing.
In general, don't just place testimonials without thinking. Take a minute to
place the testimonial in a location where it has the best chance of overcoming
the objection that is on the prospect's mind.
## Step 3: Add meat, not cheese to your testimonials
Unfortunately, we have grown skeptical of testimonials.
Too many scammers out there writing testimonials that range from clearly fake
to slightly cheesy. As a result, testimonials have to have meat on their
bones.
Consider adding the following to your testimonials to boost their credibility:
* Head shot
* Full name
* Company name
* Title
* Website URL
* Blood type
Of course I'm kidding about the blood type, but the point is that testimonials
that provide more detail will convert better. They're simply more believable.
_**
**_
For instance, the testimonial written for Jane's website design services will
be much more credible if it looked like this.
_"" Jane's website design process was so simple. She was very considerate of my
time and I came away with a professional, new website with none of the
hassle.""

## **How to effectively gather testimonials** _ **
**_
First, don't be afraid to ask for testimonials _._ A happy customer is usually
willing to provide a testimonial for you. After all, you solved their problem.
Be ready to pop the question at any point throughout your relationship with a
customer. The best time to ask is when they praise you. Customers will often
say things like:
_"" Wow, Jane! You really saved my life here. I really appreciate you being so
responsive on this problem. My boss was breathing down my neck.""_
A logical follow-up from Jane would be:
_"" It was my pleasure. I have really enjoyed working on this project. Would
you mind providing me a short testimonial for my marketing materials?""_
How can they say no to that?
Some customers don't go out of their way to compliment you, but if you know
they're happy with your services, ask for the testimonial.
## Phrase your requests for testimonials carefully
And when you ask, the way you phrase the question is critical. Remember you're
trying to address objections that prospects have while they're reading the
sales copy on your website.
For example, if Jane knows she needs a testimonial that will overcome the
price objection on her website, she could phrase the request for testimonial
this way:
_"" It was my pleasure. I have really enjoyed working on this project. Would
you mind providing me a short testimonial for my marketing materials? Perhaps
you could answer this question: 'Why do you think working with Jane on your
website redesign was a good value for your business?'""_
By phrasing the request for testimonial in this way, you make it very likely
that the customer will provide you with the testimonial you need to overcome
the price objection.
Take advantage of these tips and provide the powerful social proof needed to
increases conversions.
It's true. All testimonials are not created equally.

Copy so irresistible that readers rush hot and heavy through your sales
letter…begging to do whatever it is you want them to do.
Buy, donate or subscribe. It doesn't matter. They want to do it.
But not everyone can write sales letters like that. Unless you know the three
appeals that are behind every successful advertisement.
The good sales letters use at least one of these appeals. The best use all
three.
What are these three appeals? Let's explore.
## Sex
! Sex in your sales copy

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/big_book_of_sex.png
Soft core. Hard core. No core.
Sex sells.
Men's Health
http://www.menshealth.com/
knows this and makes a mint from
creating products and sales letter that put the physical act-and how to get
better at/more of it-as a key motivator for sales. The image above is from one
of their products- The Big Book of
Sex
http://www.mhbigbookofsex.com/uof/mhbigbookofsex/?keycode=153626&smartcode=DFP40402747X209574986 .
They do an excellent job of segmenting their audience between men and
women…and then creating appeals that, well…appeal to each:
!

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/big_book_of_sex_CTA.png
But using sex as an appeal isn't limited to the physical act. Sex includes
love, friendship and affection. This is what I mean by ""no core.""
Love Panky
http://www.lovepanky.com/tag/make-him-addicted-to-you
is
appealing to women who not only want to fall in true love with a man…but make
that same man fall in love with them.
!

content/uploads/2012/01/Love_Panky.png
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Love_Panky.png
What makes these appeals work so well is that they are native to what is being
sold. Bad uses of this appeal occur when you try to pump up sales with woman
who strip while you talk about your web domain service.
Go Daddy, anyone?
## Greed
It's in our bones. That desire to live like the rich.
Jet set around the world. Own boats as big as school buses. Spill more sashimi
than most people will eat in a lifetime.
The
Rich Jerk successfully milked this appeal for
years
http://www.therichjerk.com/ . And it's what fuels the
Motley
Fool
http://www.fool.com/ :
!
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Motley_Fool.png
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Motley_Fool.png
Greed is why magazines like Money and Fortune are popular. While these
magazines are straight-forward about their goal
getting rich
it's less
obvious in publications like Financial Times or Forbes.
But it's still there.
If you can show someone how to make six figures a year, retire young or even
horde hundreds of products through coupons
http://adage.com/article/special-
report-couponing/greed-outweighs-frugality-tlc-s-extreme-
couponing/228624/ …then you are using the greed appeal correctly.
## Fear
Just like sex sells, so does fear. It could be a test crash dummy hitting a
dash board at 60 miles per hour. A group of teenagers piling up body bags
outside of the headquarters of a cigarette manufacturer. Or a life of poverty
for your children after you die.
!
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/crash_test.png
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/crash_test.png
Fear appeals work on that sense of uncertainty we have. This is why insurance
and services like tax shelters that protect your money from the hands of the
government and greedy lawyers are so effective.
For example, look at the headline below from
Stansberry
Research
http://www.stansberryresearch.com/pub/psi/ :
!
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/change_your_life1.png
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/change_your_life1.png
At first blush it might not seem to be about fear, but notice the phrase
""change your life."" There's the uncertainty I was talking about. It's combined
with the bad news of the U.S. debt downgrade to make an intriguing headline
that could prove crucial if you decide to ignore.
## Putting It All Together
Using just one of these appeals in your sales letter will get you some good
response. Use two, and you'll get even better. All three…that's a sales letter
orgasm.
The headline
Loud Sex Is a Billion Dollar
Problem
http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonbittner/2011/09/20/loud-sex-is-a-
billion-dollar-problem/
from Forbes combines fear and greed and sex
effectively:
!
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/loud_sex.png
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/loud_sex.png
You've got the sex, greed
""Billion Dollar""
and the fear
""Problem"" . This
wouldn't make a great sales letter headline, however. You know why? It's not
clear that the problem impacts the reader or that he'll personally benefit if
he reads the copy.
If you want to do that you'd write ""Why the Loud Sex Problem Is Costing You a
Billion Dollars.""
Greed is behind the Publishing Clearing House's Sweepstakes and state lottery
games. Illinois took it a step further and hilariously wove
fear into their
greed appeal
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnAPhhrhytI .

content/uploads/2012/01/5000_for_life.png
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/5000_for_life.png
Let me close with a little secret: out of all of the above appeals greed is
the most powerful. Meaning, if you can appeal to people's greed you are going
to write a better sales letter. This is born out by my own experience…and it's
born out by copywriting veterans like John Caples.
Then again, if you can write a sales letter appeal combining all three…you
just might be able to retire young in a radioactive-safe bunker with Angelina
Jolie. Or Brad Pitt.
Your choice.
## Your Turn
By the way, the title of this post is ""The Sexiest Way to Make So Much Money
It Scares You.""
Got any idea what that is?
My idea was simply to combine all three appeals together in a sales letter,
but I was wondering if anybody could come up with a real occupation or gimmick
that combines all three.
Matching ponies to the person who shares the best idea.

start letter: DEAR POTENTIAL CUSTOMER:Have I got a deal for you which I know
you will not want to pass up. That will peak the reader's interest to read
more. Once you catch their attention, the sale content is up to you.

*
For a lot of bloggers, self hosting with Wordpress.org provides the most
professional blogging platform available. If you started out using Blogger and
now need a professional presence, there's a good chance that you're ready to
switch to Wordpress.org.
But the point of this article isn’t to convince you to switch. If you're
trying to decide whether or not to switch, there are better articles to read.
But if you have decided to switch, this post will walk you through step by
step how to quickly and easily transfer from Blogger to Wordpress.org.
## Step 1: Sign up for hosting
! Blue Host Web hosting
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Web-hosting-Blue-
Host.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Web-
hosting-Blue-Host.jpg
The first step in transferring from Blogger to Wordpress.org is to sign up for
hosting. If you haven’t picked out a hosting company yet,
Blue
Host
http://www.bluehost.com
offers low prices that are competitive with
other popular Wordpress hosts, and they’re also reliable. To top it off, they
provide excellent customer service, and they’re control panel is one of the
easiest to use. You can’t go wrong by choosing Blue Host.
Another good choice is
Host Gator
http://www.hostgator.com . They offer some
of the best rates in the business, and they're known for their excellent
customer service.
_Note: If you haven’t already purchased a domain name, Blue Host also offers a
free domain name when you set up your account._
## Step 2: Install Wordpress on your hosting account
! Blue Host hosting panel
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Blue-Host-hosting-
panel.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Blue-
Host-hosting-panel.jpg
After signing up for hosting, the next step is to install Wordpress on your
hosting account. To do so, first log into your hosting control panel. Next,
find the Wordpress icon located underneath a heading such as “Simplescripts
Installation” or ""Software/Services."" The wording will be different for each
hosting company, and you can always start a live chat with customer support if
you need help. Once you find the icon, follow the steps to install Wordpress.
_Note: If possible, you’ll want to install Wordpress as a temporary
installment. This will allow you to set up the site on a temporary site so you
aren’t making all of the changes live while your readers are watching._
## Step 3: Import to Wordpress
! Wordpress Importer
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Wordpress-Importer-
dashboard.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Wordpress-Importer-dashboard.jpg
The next step is to import posts from Blogger to Wordpress. To do so, log into
your temporary wordpress installment by going to
http://yourtemporarydomain.com/wp-admin. After logging in, go to the left-hand
sidebar and click on “Tools” and then select “Import Posts.” On the next page
where you'll be asked which type of posts you’d like to import, choose the
option titled “Blogger.”
You'll next be asked if you’d like to install an “importer for Blogger.” The
answer is yes, so click the red button to install the importer. Then click to
activate and install the plugin. You’ll now click to authorize Wordpress to
access your Blogger account, and then follow the steps to import posts from
Blogger to Wordpress.
## Step 4: Double check the content
! Number of posts
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Number-posts.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Number-posts.jpg
Now that the posts have been transferred, you’ll need to double check that all
of the posts and comments transferred correctly. You can do this by comparing
the number of posts and comments in Wordpress to the number of posts and
comments in Blogger. You'll have at least one extra post and one extra page in
Wordpress due to the fact that Wordpress automatically generates a welcome
post and sample page when it’s first installed. You’ll want to delete each of
these posts and pages.
_Note: Sometimes not all of the posts or comments transfer correctly. If this
is the case, there may or may or may not be an easy way to get all of the
posts transferred. You can contact Blogger or troubleshoot by searching on
Google if these posts are critical for your blog. In cases like this, it’s
often easier to not worry about the lost posts and move on._
## Step 5: Choose and configure a theme
! Wordpress theme install
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Wordpress-Theme-
Install.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Wordpress-Theme-Install.jpg
After making sure the content transferred correctly and is ready to go,
navigate to “Appearance” in the right-hand sidebar of the Wordpress dashboard
and select themes.Then click ""Install Themes"" at the top of the page and
follow the steps to install a new Wordpress theme.
You’ll want to pick out a theme that you like and configure it to work the way
you want it to. After picking the right theme for your site, you can take some
time to configure it to look the way you want it to by installing plugins and
widgets and adding pages. You can even pay a designer for a custom theme if
you’re so inclined.
## Step 6: Change the permalink structure in Wordpress
! Permalink structure
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Permalink-
structure.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Permalink-structure.jpg
The next step is to change the permalink structure in Wordpress. The reason
you have to do this is that Blogger does crazy things with their permalink
structure. In order to minimize the number of broken links, you'll need to
change the permalink structure in Wordpress to match the crazy setup in
Blogger.
To do this, click on ""Settings"" in the left-hand sidebar of the Wordpress
dashboard, and then click permalinks. Now, click the radio button for ""custom
structure."" To the right of the button, copy and paste this:
/%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%.html
The permalink structure in Wordpress will now match the structure on the old
Blogger site. This will cause _most_ of the links to work properly and
minimize the number of broken links.
_Note: This will minimize the number of broken links, but it won 't eliminate
them entirely. This is due to the fact that Blogger removes articles such as
""a,"" ""an,"" and ""the"" from urls for post titles and Wordpress does not. Because
of this, a post with a title such as, ""The Absolute Best Way to Start a
Wordpress Blog,"" will have a url that looks like ""www.yourdomain.com/absolute-
best-way-start-wordpress-blog"" in Blogger and ""www.yourdomain.com/the-
absolute-best-way-to-start-a-wordpress-blog"" in Wordpress. One way to fix this
is to go through and manually change the broken urls in Wordpress. The other
way is to not worry about it. If there's a third and better way and you know
what that is, make sure to leave a comment at the end of this post._
## Step 7: Sign up for and configure Feedburner
!
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Feedburner.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Feedburner.jpg
Now that you're using Wordpress, you'll need to sign up for Feedburner in
order to manage RSS feeds and subscriptions yourself. Start by going to
Feedburner
http://www.feedburner.com
and signing up for an account. You'l
then walk through the steps to set up your Feedburner account and burn a feed.
If you need more instructions about how to do that, you can find that out
here
http://www.mamablogga.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-migrating-from-blogger-
to-wordpress/
and
here
http://www.mamablogga.com/getting-started-with-
feedburner/ .
## Step 8: Change the domain settings
! phpMyAdmin
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/php-
My-Admin.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/php-
My-Admin.jpg
Now that the new Wordpress site is set up and ready to go, you're ready to
change the domain settings of your temporary site
this assumes that you set
up the site on a temporary domain . To do this, log into your hosting panel
and find an icon labeled ""phpMyAdmin"" and click. Next, click on ""databases""
and then click the database for your Wordpress installation. Now, find
""wp_options"" and click. Line 1 will be for your site url. Click to edit this
line and change it out the url from the temporary one to the permanent one.
Now, click ""wp_options"" again, click to edit line 37, and again replace the
temporary url with the new one.
_Note: If this step becomes too difficult, contact customer for your hosting
account. There 's a good chance that they can walk you through it by chat or
even make the change for you._
## Step 9: Forward the nameservers
!
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Domain-
manager.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/Domain-manager.jpg
The next and final step is to forward the nameservers for your domain name. To
do this, you'll log into the dashboard where you purchased your domain. You'll
then click to manage the domain and then click to edit the nameservers. You'll
do this by replacing them with the nameserver information where your site is
hosted. The new nameservers will look something like this: ns1.bluehost.com
and ns2.bluehost.com.

NIce article but not perfect reason being you ignored the SEO aspect of it..!!
Here are two additions:
Use Blogger permalink fix plugin before changing your permalinks in WordPress,
that will take care of slugs which were ignored in BlogSpot..
Use Image cache plugin to import all images from Picasa to your WordPress
server….
Overall useful for beginners.. ! :\

Hello Russ.
Nice article I must say.
Regarding the blogger permalink fix issue as correctly pointed by Mr. Harsh
above, you can use a file Fix.php with the code as given in this
article
http://bloggertowp.org/migrate-from-blogger-to-wordpress-best-
tutorial/ .
Hope your readers will be benefited with it.

I decided to migrate my blog to WP -3.3.1- from Blogger by inspiring from this
post. After migrating the blog and running fix.php with installing ""Permalink
Fİnder"" plugin, permalink problem still remains. Even I take a look at the DB
-wp_posts & wp_postmeta- with PMA but nothing can't be seen. Is this method
compatible w/ WP 3.3.1?

*
The name Amazon.com has become synonymous with eCommerce.
If you are reading this blog, there is no doubt that you have ordered
something from Amazon.com from the comforts of your desktop or laptop
computer.
Today, it is only slightly less likely that you have ordered something from
Amazon from your phone.
I'm no exception. Yesterday, I ordered a pair of ear buds on my iPhone from
Amazon in between the time my dental hygienist cleaned my teeth and the
dentist came in to give me the verdict.
We asked our Crazy Egg Design and Marketing Experts to analyze the Amazon
mobile website design. Take a hard look yourself, read through our opinions
and, if you are so inclined, give us your analysis in the comments below.

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/keller.jpg Design aspects that Amazon's Mobile
Homepage is doing well include:
1\. Using a simple one column structure as a list view for the interface.
Adding multi column structures for any small mobile device makes the entire
real estate feel crammed and harder to use.
2\. Keeping things simple by introducing high level functions and options that
are most important such as: search, cart, wish list, streamlined menus.
3\. Information for the product is minimal to start, but if user is
interested, they can go to the next layout with more details. Biggest mistake
most people make is providing too much copy/content on one screen, especially
for mobile.
4\. Option to use full site at the bottom. Providing the user the option to
choose experience is important.
5\. Graphics, colors, and overall aesthetics are clean and minimal - which
help performance and keep maintenance costs lower.

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-

site should be very simple; make it as easy as possible for someone to find a
product and complete a purchase. This successfully achieves that, and by
focusing on the most popular product categories
Books, Kindle, Movies and
Electronics
it can keep the navigation as intuitive as possible.
I'm also really happy to see that they offer a clear link to the Amazon.com
full site. It's amazing how many mobile sites don't do this.

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-

example of a mobile optimized website. It's easy to navigate and gives the
user what they are looking for right away - the amazon search bar.
The ad below the search bar for Amazon Apps doesn't appear to be an ad at all
and is, very likely, the reason the user navigated to Amazon on their mobile
device in the first place.
The mobile site seems easy to navigate since appears very similar to the
regular website. The cart is at the top, always reminding you how many items
you have so far and the search bar and department categories are easy to
navigate as well.

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/lee.png Amazon are usability experts. Their website
isn't the prettiest thing out there, nor is their mobile site, but they do an
amazing job of getting users to the products they want! I buy just about
everything I own from Amazon and I do that not only because of pricing but
because it can be easier to find it on Amazon than my local retail outlet.
Retailers, are you listening?
Given how much attention Amazon pays to what users are doing on their site,
they most likely took their top categories and made them easily accessible.
The arrows on the buttons are great functional suggestions. I can tell that if
I push Books the page is going to slide down in an accordion effect and I can
tell that if I push See All Departments I'm going to head off to another
screen. This is very effective in letting the user know what's going to
happen. To the savvy user it lets you know what you can do with a spotty 3G/4G
connection and what you may want to wait for a more stable connection to do.
I love how the account specific and sub-categories are styled differently.
This style change lets me know that these choices are specific to me and/or my
account.
Finally, the best part of all, FULL SITE! I can't tell you how many poor
mobile sites I've been to where the experience was so lacking I wanted to go
to the full site. You know what those poor mobile sites all have in common?
They don't let you go to the full site! A+ to Amazon for giving me the freedom
to choose. **

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/sahayam.png The site looks very clean and easy to use.
The theme matches the www.amazon.com theme and helps promote the website's
branding.
The two containers
blue and yellow
have different styles. The blue one has
rounded corners and is smaller in width than the yellow one - which has square
corners. It might be more consistent if they were both the same style unless
they are supposed to be separated.
From the screenshot it is unclear as to whether the department list is used
when a search is done
as is the case on the www.amazon.com . This is mainly
due to having advertisement in between the search field and the department
list.
The Cart and Wishlist links are duplicated once up the top and once down the
bottom. Given that mobile screen space is limited, one set should be removed.

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/schwartz.jpg This is a very useful mobile page. It has
most of the features of the main site, in a smaller format with quick links to
get to the most popular items. I would guess that Amazon has research or
analytics telling them which categories are essential to show on this page, so
I trust their judgment.
I could nitpick some stuff
like wasting so much height on the ad for the
Kindle Fire ensuring that anyone on an iPhone will never see the menus without
scrolling down first , but I said I wouldn't nitpick so I'll stop.

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-

Mobile home page design is the fact that it is a simple design that one can
identify as Amazon just by the fonts and colors. The use of the viewable space
before you would have to scroll below the fold
is great. The subtle
placement of ""deals"" below the logo is pretty sly, plus having the button to
promote the mobile app below the search bar is a great idea. The end user may
find it easier to download the app and have it readily available then have to
navigate to Amazon each time through the phone's browser. **

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/schottmuller.png The Amazon mobile home page does an
impressive job of presenting their large and complex navigation into a scaled
down intuitive menu. The order and use of different colors for the primary and
secondary menus helps provide visual clarity. I like that they've featured
search and their mobile app at the top of the page, since those are likely top
actions for mobile users. The blue primary accent color leaves orange
opposite on the color wheel
as the optimal CTA color which they implemented
fairly well.
On the improvement note, links on the page need an audit check for adequate
text size and padding to ensure they're easily clickable.
Tip: Your pinky
nail can work as a handy mobile sizing/spacing guide for links since it's
mostly likely the size of the your index finger's pressable surface area.

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-

popular navigation options. I'm sure that Amazon tested this pretty thoroughly
before concluding what people would click on most.
The only thing I'd like if I were to use that application is that the
advertisement was further down underneath the departments. It seems more
intuitive to have them directly underneath the search box instead. **

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-

excellent balance between easy navigation to a lot of different places
which
is absolutely necessary, given the complexity of the site , and showcasing the
product that they are currently trying to ""push""
currently the Kindle Fire .
The guideline that I'd take away from this design is that first you want to
put front and center in front of your audience whatever you want them to see,
and then immediately give them access to anything that they might be looking
for.

http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/henneberry.jpg First, I think it is clear that getting
the word out about Kindle Fire is a primary goal of Amazon's. I like the way
the product is featured with an image and a clear call-to-action without
trying to say too much on the mobile home page. If you want to know more,
click the ""Learn More"" link.
Secondly, it is clear that it has been detected that I am using an iPhone to
reach the mobile version of the website. This has caused the mobile home page
to display a call-to-action to download their iPhone applications.
Lastly, the navigation is brilliantly organized which is no small feat for a
company that sells the wide array of products that Amazon sells. They list the
most popular ""departments"" on the home page and then a link to ""See All
Departments"" if you don't find what you are looking for. This allows them to
serve the majority of people without cluttering up the mobile interface with
links. **

I think the navigation is great. And the color scheme is transcendent of their
desktop version. Amazon's branding is their usability… digitally at least.
They are missing a huge oppertunity to harness that same gut feeling through
their TV and print media

*
Engaging voters online is an increasingly important part of the electoral
process. The 2008 Presidential campaign saw Barack Obama and the Democratic
Party rightly complimented for their effective use of web technology and
social media. As the Republican presidential primary campaign continues, has
the GOP learned some of those lessons? How are the four remaining candidates
portraying themselves online?
##
Mitt Romney
http://mittromney.com
! Screenshot of Mitt Romney's Campaign
Website
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-

content/uploads/2012/01/mittromney.jpg
Romney makes a big mistake immediately by hiding his main website behind a
very mundane splash page. The splash page is intended to encourage people to
sign up for updates about the campaign, and the need for any candidate to
develop a strong ""user list"" is important. But this call to action could
easily have been incorporated into the main site; right now the first
experience anyone has visiting Romney's campaign site is a mediocre and
unattractive extra-step. I'm sure it's going to put off a lot of visitors.
Once you get past the splash page, Romney has a pretty appealing site. The
layout is strong, and makes really effective use of imagery. Good use of white
space gives a clean and professional look. It's easy to find more about Romney
and his stance on the issues, as well as latest campaign news. It's also the
only site that provides really visible links to state specific information for
all 50 states.
I like the very clear calls to action for the main social media services.
Facebook, Twitter and Google+ options to share major stories are seamlessly
integrated, and there are separate options for engaging with the candidate
directly on social media. This suggests a clear understanding that there's a
distinction between building social media followers, and sharing content.
**GRADE: B-**
##
Newt Gingrich
http://newt.org
! Screenshot of Newt Gingrich's Campaign
Website
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/newtgingrich.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/newtgingrich.jpg
Gingrich's site scores highly for usability, but doesn't have a really strong
visual impact. It's well put together but very traditional in its layout and
appearance. Kind of like a very standard blog template - and that means it
looks dated.
Navigation is simple, and there are very clear calls to action for anyone
interested in getting involved with the campaign, donating, or buying campaign
related merchandise. Social media seems very much an afterthought
surprising,
given that Gingrich has a massive Twitter following compared to any of the
other candidates .
It also looks like some areas of the site aren't updated often enough. As I
write this, there are still sections on helping Gingrich win in the Iowa
caucus or New Hampshire primary, both events that happened a couple of weeks
ago.
**GRADE: C+**
##
Ron Paul
http://ronpaul2012.com
! Screenshot of Ron Paul's Campaign
Website
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/ronpaul.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/ronpaul.jpg
Ron Paul's the only candidate using WordPress for his campaign website
all
the other candidates use Drupal . Initial engagement is strong. I really like
his donation thermometer with a real time count, and the ""recent donor"" helps
to suggest that the Paul campaign engages with individual people. It makes for
a powerful call to action for donations.
I was confused navigating around the site. The two columns of articles on the
front page
one is an opinion-based 'Paulitical Ticker', the other is 'Ron
Paul in the News'
aren't very well differentiated. The navigation bar has too
many options, and the different sections of the site could be more clearly
defined.
Social media integration is relatively low key, and the site is generally more
""wordy"" than the others
as, indeed, Paul is as a candidate . I think it would
benefit from a larger font size, it's fallen into the ""12 pixel trap"" that
might look OK at first glance but isn't that well suited to easily browsing
text.
**GRADE: B-**
##
Rick Santorum
http://ricksantorum.com
! Screenshot of Rick Santorum's Campaign
Website
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/ricksantorum.jpg
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/ricksantorum.jpg
I just don't like this website. The layout is odd, and looks very strange in
larger windows; it's like they've tried to create a fluid width layout without
really understanding the principle. It's blocky, a little ugly, and has bad
typography. Add in a lack of any clear call to action, and I'm unsure what the
site is trying to achieve.
Even the language is a little unusual, with some sections written in the third
person and some sections written in the first person. It gives the feeling of
a ""made by committee"" website that doesn't have any strong creative vision or
sense of purpose.
Of all the primary candidate websites, Santorum's is the one that looks the
most amateurish. The first time it took me a few moments to work out where the
navigation was; the site layout works in such a way as to completely draw the
eye away from that menu.
**GRADE: D**
## Conclusions
It's clear that the leading GOP candidates have upped their game and
understand the importance of a good website
former candidates John Huntsman,
Rick Perry, Herman Cain and Michelle Bachmann also have reasonably polished
sites . There's still a lot of room to improve. None of the sites use any HTML
5 technology, their SEO is basic, and none of the design is particularly
outstanding.
The GOP candidates may have taken some steps to improve their online presence,
but they have a long way to go.

*
If you are a Twitter hashtag veteran, bear with me for a moment. We will get
to some advanced stuff shortly.
For those that are new to Twitter hashtags, let's start with the basics.
## What are Twitter Hashtags?
Hashtags are a way of organizing Twitter. Twitter users are able to sort
tweets that contain a particular hashtag. By viewing tweets that contain a
hashtag, we are able to have conversations about topics on Twitter.
For example, any tweet with the #webdesign hashtag added to it can be easily
found using Twitter.com or 3rd party tools like Hootsuite and Tweetdeck.
Adding a hashtag to a tweet allows it to go beyond your own network to as many
people that are following that hashtag to see real time conversation about
that topic.
You can see a hashtag in action by simply tweeting this post - I used the
hashtag #WebDesign in the title so everyone who tweets it will get to use one
right off the bat!
## How to Use Twitter Hashtags
Hashtags can be used in a variety of ways for different purposes. Some useful
ways to use them include the following.
**Gain a Wider Audience for Your Message**
Add a hashtag to your tweets
when relevant
to get a wider audience for your
update. This way, instead of just your followers seeing your latest tweet on
web design, you can add #webdesign to your tweet to get anyone who is
following that hashtag to see it as well.
**Capitalize on Trending Topics**
! Twitter Trending Topics
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/twitter-trending-topics.png
Be on the lookout for trending topic hashtags and add them to your tweets when
applicable. Use the Trending topics on your Twitter homepage to see the
latest. If you are looking to target a local marketing, click on the _change_
link to see trends within a specific location.
! Twitter Trend Location
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/twitter-trend-location.png
If you're not sure what a particular trend is about, you can click on it to
see the latest tweets or go to
What the Trend
http://www.whatthetrend.com/
to see other user's explanations of why something is popular.
**Monitor Industry News**
! Following Twitter Hashtags in HootSuite
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/following-hashtags-hootsuite.png
Want to follow hashtags in your industry? You can do it a few different ways.
You could search for the hashtag on Twitter and use the _Save this search_
button to save it on your Twitter account. But a better way to do it would be
to use a Twitter management tool like
HootSuite
http://hootsuite.com/
shown above ,
Tweetdeck
http://www.tweetdeck.com/ , or similar. These
programs allow you to add a column to your dashboard with the hashtag and will
automatically update the stream as new tweets come in.
In HootSuite, you would click the Add Stream button, then add #webdesign as
your search query under the Search tab.
! Add Stream in HootSuite
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/hootsuite-add-stream.png
In Tweetdeck, you would click the Add Column button, select Search as the
column type, and enter #webdesign in the search box.
! Tweetdeck Add Column
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/tweetdeck-add-column-search.png
This is a great way to see the latest tweets on industry-related hashtags.
You'll probably see everything from random quotes, popular articles, and even
job listings.
**Answer Questions on a Particular Topic**
! Follow Hashtag Questions in HootSuite
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/following-hashtag-questions-hootsuite.png
Take the above tip on following industry hashtags one step further by
following questions asked on a particular hashtag by using the search query
_#webdesign ? -filter:links_. Setting this search up on Twitter, HootSuite,
Tweetdeck, or similar applications will allow you to see questions asked about
a particular topic
mostly
without any links in the tweet. Answer these
questions to help build your authority in the web design industry!
**Create Valuable Resources**
! Web Design Paper.li
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/web-design-paper.png
You can use sites like Paper.li which will allow you to create ""newspapers""
around hashtags. You can see this
web design
daily
http://paper.li/rainbeauxmedia/1294329103
as an example.
**Find the Top Products**
! Hashtag Analytics on Topsy
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-

products.png
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/topsy-analytics-find-top-products.png
As a web designer, you might be asked your opinion on using particular things
such as blog platforms. Use
Topsy Analytics
http://analytics.topsy.com/
and
enter the platforms mentioned by your client as hashtags to see the number of
people talking about them. The one talked about the most is probably the best
choice for your client and you, as the designer, since there will be more
community support.
## Great Twitter Hashtags for Web Designers
The following are a sampling of various design related hashtags that you can
add to your own tweets or monitor within the web design industry.
* #webdesign - Use this with any tweets on web design.
* #webdesigner - Great hashtag if you are looking for a job as a web designer.
* #typography - Want to talk type? Any font discussions and type inspiration should get tagged with this!
* #cms - Talk about your favorite content management system
like #wordpress, #joomal, or #drupal
using this hashtag.
* #branding - If you're trying to attract business clients, be sure to emphasize how important branding is when it comes to great web design.
* #webdevelopment - Once you're beyond the design, you have to dig into the functionality. Use this hashtag to talk programming and beyond.
* #html5 and #css3 - Get in on conversation about the latest resources for web programming.
* #inspiration - Combined with #webdesign or even just #design, this tag tells others about the most inspiring sites or designs to spark some creative energy.
* #UX - The most creative web design can fail if the user experience isn't up to par. Talk about user experience with this hashtag.
* #templates - Looking for a base template, or designing one for others? Add this hashtag with #webdesign or #design to get your message to the right audience.
Also, don't forget about Twitter chats! Twitter chats are formed when groups
of people meet at a certain time on Twitter to discuss a certain topic and use
a specific hashtag, like #designchat. This Twitter chat for creative
professionals happens on Wednesday at 8PM CST for one hour. Use the
TweetChat
http://tweetchat.com/room/designchat
site to monitor and engage
with this Twitter chat. Find more Twitter chats and hashtags on the
Twitter
Chat

## How to Determine Which Hashtag to Use
! Twitter Hashtag Popularity on Topsy
Analytics
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/twitter-
hashtag-popularity-topsy-analytics.png
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/twitter-hashtag-popularity-topsy-analytics.png
If you're debating about using different variations of a hashtag like
#webdesigner, #webdesign, or #web #design, then enter all three on the earlier
mentioned
Topsy Analytics
http://analytics.topsy.com/
tool. It will show
you a graph of how many times each hashtag has been mentioned in the last day,
week, two weeks, or month. Then Scroll down for a sampling of tweets with that
hashtag plus some useful data about them.
! Top Links in Topsy Analytics
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/topsy-analytics-top-links.png
The number under All shows the number of times that particular link has been
tweeted. The number under Influential shows the likelihood that an influential
user on Twitter will notice your update using that hashtag. Seeing how each
tag is used and the popularity of tweets within the tag should help you make
the best decision on what to use with your tweet.
## Hashtags Aren't Just for Twitter Anymore
! Hashtags on Google+
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/hashtags-on-google-plus.png
Hashtags are no longer only for Twitter. They are starting to gain popularity
on Google+ as well. Check out posts on Google+ tagged with
#webdesign
https://plus.google.com/s/%23WebDesign
and start thinking about
how you can incorporate hashtags to expand your Google+ audience as well. To
monitor industry discussion on Google+, search for a hashtag and then use the
_Save this search_ button.
! Google+ Save This Search
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/google-plus-save-this-search.png
Then follow the discussion anytime using the links in the left sidebar of your
Google+ account.
! Google+ Saved Searches
http://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/google-plus-saved-searches.png
Getting on Google+ hashtags could be a great way to get new followers - just
be sure that your updates are Public so everyone can see them!

designers to use or follow? Please share them in the comments!_

Cool overview. Definitely find there are a lot of people out there who have a
vague conception about what hashtags are, but don't really know how to use
them effectively. You can find some great tweets leading to great resources by
permanently or semi-permanently following certain hashtags
although I tend to
find that I end up with too many Tweetdeck columns if I try and follow
everything I want! .
If you're aiming at an external audience, be careful of the hashtags you're
using. Most particularly, be aware of some of the acronyms that might be
confusing. Something like #cms or #ux are easily recognizable to people within
a certain industry, but perhaps you're trying to provide some resources to
explain or introduce these topics; if that's the cause then the audience might
not be well targeted by the use of acronyms.
Question on the paper.li; I often get tagged as having contributed to these,
but I can't remember ever really getting any return traffic to my website, or
Twitter follows, that are identifiably from that source. Are there any
statistics on whether paper.li sites have any real audience on an individual
basis? It's an interesting aggregator service, but certainly I tend to trust
personally curated sites far more.

Hi Robin,
Good point on the acronym hashtags. ! :\
http://blog.crazyegg.com/wp-
includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif
Do you use Google Analytics? I see paper.li and their competitors, scoop.it &
summify.com in my Traffic Sources > Referral Traffic section. With paper.li,
you can click on the link in your Referral Traffic to see which users' papers
have sent the most traffic, and with the other two, you can see which posts on
your site got the most traffic from them.

Starting at 9:00am this morning, the Committee on Oversight & Government
Reform is
carrying a live
feed
http://issues.oversight.house.gov/fastandfurious/hearing2.html
of of
Eric Holder's testimony in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee.
Mathew Staver
says
http://www.therightplanet.com/2012/02/issa-holder-has-
blood-on-his-hands/
due to previous inconsistent testimony that was riddled
with misdirection and cover-up, Attorney General Eric Holder is being forced
into a showdown with Rep. Darrell Issa and the committee
OGRC
today.
Labeled a ""hostile witness"" by Chairman Issa, Holder and the Department of
Justice must now satisfactorily explain their roles and subsequent actions in
the now infamous ""Fast and Furious"" debacle that resulted in the murder of a
U.S. Border Agent and a yet to be determined loss of life in Mexico.
Chairman Issa recently declared that the Department of Justice ""has blood on
their hands."" Liberty Counsel Action has launched a powerful Fax Barrage
telling Chairman Issa and his committee that Americans are OUTRAGED over
Holder’s deplorable performance as Attorney General.
Sadly, ""Fast and Furious"" is just one instance of gross mismanagement that
justifies our call for Eric Holder’s forced resignation, firing, or
impeachment!

Shot missed the first 40 minutes!
But so far it's about gun control with
Holder and his ""hands on"" management style.

Oh my goodness, Holder is such a slimball!
Won't answer a question and tries
to make it political again!
Won't take responsibility and scolds the congress
women for try to get him to.
""It's beneath a member of congress to ask a
question like that.""

Connolly - Hopefully your predecessor will come in and give testimony
regarding Wide receiver & gun walking.
Blame Bush
Then gun control is
needed...
Idiot!
Meehan is bringing it and making Holder very nervous! Holder is avoiding the
issues being brought up, ""their still investigating it"".
Refuses to give info
at this time regarding investigations and wire taps applications.
Quigley
IL
- Stop deflecting. Gun control - how about resources on the
border.
Obama's ""budget"" gave $57 mil. less then AFT asked for resulting on
less resources on the border. Holder - ATF is important but the money's not
there.
Dr. Desjarlais - Frustrated with the stonewalling - showing "" stonewall
city
http://www.flickr.com/photos/oversight/6803523249/sizes/l/in/set-72157628141160176/ .""
Holder admits to the 24 hr notice of agent Terry's murder but didn't know it
was connected to F&F.
Holder
Still waiting on internal reports to see if
acted we appropriately. There is no cover up. We are not hiding anything. We
respond to legitimate requests timely.
Issa - When you give us the Constitutional basis for with holding requested
information the accusation of a ""cover up""
will go away.
Davis
IL
- What info is being held from the Congress investigation and why?
Holder - Our internal investigation and reports that are not complete.
personal note: Davis surprised me, he seems very concerned and wants this to
get this cleared up accurately. Not partisan at all.
Mr. Gowdy- Going over documented emails and memos with dates that are
mentioning F&F, 1500 guns walked, how to cover instead of fixing, walked guns
regarding cases being prosecuted in AZ to main DOJ; going back to 2009.
HOlder - trying to put it back into wide receiver. Gowdy is not letting him
get away with it - memo's state Fast & Furious, not wide receiver ""tricky case
considering how many guns have walked"". Taking a break because Holder said
he's not familiar with those memos - giving him time to look them over. Gowdy
""We got them from your office"".

Gowdy - I didn't include other memo's that where not specific to F&F.
Did DOJ
people know about F&F?
Holder - a few lower levels.
Gowdy is completely
bowling Holder away!
I have to get to my daughter's school... Have to catch-up later, sorry.

**Groundhog Day: Holder repeats Fast and Furious lies**
IBD EDitorials
says
http://news.investors.com/Article/599949/201202021852/holder-repeats-
fast-and-furious-lies.htm
it's a scandal.
In a shameful performance, the attorney general Thursday reprised his tap-
dancing routine before a panel investigating the Fast and Furious gunrunning
operation that got U.S. agents and Mexicans killed.
'It's Groundhog Day, and Brian Terry's family and taxpayers are still waiting
for Fast and Furious answers from the Justice Department,"" Chairman Darrell
Issa said before the hearings. ""We will not wait until the next Groundhog Day
to get answers for the American people.""
Rep. Issa, R-Calif., has threatened Attorney General Eric Holder with a
contempt of Congress citation if he doesn't get answers to questions on Fast
and Furious, such as who authorized it and what and when Holder knew. The
story constantly changes.
After Thursday's deja vu hearing in front of Issa's House Government Oversight
Committee, we're still waiting. The attorney general keeps insisting he didn't
authorize it, that he's still not sure when he became aware of it, and, no, no
one has been held responsible for providing weapons to Mexican drug cartels.
""There is no attempt at any kind of cover-up,"" Holder said under questioning.
""We have shared huge amounts of information"" and continue to do so.
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., noted that the Justice Department has released only
6,400 pages of the 93,000 pages of documents related to Fast and Furious, with
the rest being held under some arcane and specious separation of powers
argument.
Thursday's hearings came almost a year to the day that Holder and the Justice
Department sent a letter to Congress lying about what it knew and what it did
about Fast and Furious. Holder was appearing for the third time to continue to
weave his tangled web of deceit and falsehoods.
As in the movie ""Groundhog Day,"" it is a fable we are constantly forced to
relive.
On Feb. 4, 2011, Assistant Attorney General Ron Welch, in response to the
investigations by Issa and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, of the gun ""walking""
program run out of ATF's Phoenix office, wrote a letter stating that the
""allegation that ATF 'sanctioned' or otherwise knowingly allowed the sale of
assault weapons ... is false.""
After a series of Friday document dumps exposed DOJ's deceit, Deputy Attorney
General James Cole, in another letter to Congress, wrote, ""Facts have come to
light during the course of this investigation that indicate the Feb. 4 letter
contains inaccuracies.""
In other words, the Justice Department lied to Congress.
It lied again Thursday in the person of the attorney general who once again
failed to provide the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Eric Holder and his department have lied to Congress. Scooter Libby was
sentenced to prison for much less. We await Holder's fate and hope justice
will prevail.

**Brian Terry’s mother to Holder: You’re ‘a joke’ and a ‘coward’**
_By Matthew Boyle - The Daily Caller_
The mother of murdered Border Patrol agent Brian Terry had harsh words for
Attorney General Eric Holder after Thursday’s House oversight committee
hearing on Operation Fast and Furious.
“THIS IS FOR YOU SON,” Mrs. Terry posted on Facebook at about 3:30 p.m. “Mr.
Holder. How come you can never say my sons name. You never have. All i ever
hear you say is ‘i didnt find out or I cant say’ Im actually tired of hearing
your double talk in answering questions. What a joke you are. You know my son
was a real AMERICAN, a WARRIOR, and a HERO, who was also protecting COWARD
POLITICANS like you.”
“Hope you remember that,” Mrs. Terry added in her message to Holder before
signing it: “PROUD MOM OF BRIAN A. TERRY.”
The Holder _Waffen_ DoJ protects the Usurper, while supporting Killers of
Americans for political usefulness in destroying our Second Amendment.
I believe it was Thomas Jefferson that said ""We will learn the true reason for
the Second Amendment when they try to take it away.""

**Gowdy repeats call for Holder to resign ""the easy way,"" or be impeached ""the
hard way""**
Matthew Boyle is reporting that South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy
reaffirmed
his call
http://dailycaller.com/2011/12/09/gowdy-holder-should-
resign-or-face-impeachment/
for Attorney General Eric Holder’s resignation
""the easy way,"" or impeachment ""the hard way,"" during an interview with The
Daily Caller after Thursday’s House oversight committee hearing during which
Holder testified about Operation Fast and Furious.
While he was questioning Holder at the hearing, Gowdy explained that officials
at the Department of Justice’s headquarters were aware of Fast and Furious and
gun-walking tactics long before a ""demonstrably false"" letter was sent to Iowa
Sen. Chuck Grassley claiming otherwise.
Since the DOJ sent that letter, which
stated it never let guns walk, it has withdrawn the letter because it of its
inaccuracies.
""I think he wound up admitting at the end
of the hearing
that Main Justice
knew of gun-walking, so this notion that we’re going to blame it all on the
United States Attorney’s office in Arizona or ATF \-- I went through a litany
of people, all of them were Main Justice employees who knew about gunwalking
both in Fast and Furious and before which means the letter that was sent to
Senator Grassley was demonstrably false,"" Gowdy told TheDC.
""We still haven’t gotten any of his emails,"" noted Gowdy, ""we don’t have any
documents after February 4, so it’s clear to me that people at Main Justice
knew that gun-walking was going on in Fast and Furious.
It’s also clear to me
that absolutely nothing has happened to a single solitary person as a result
of this other than one dead Border Patrol agent and lots of Mexican citizens.
Beyond that, I can’t find a single consequence that has befallen anybody who
knew about this.""
Regardless of the mounting evidence that high-ranking officials were aware of
and approved gun-walking \-- which includes what Gowdy laid out and
newly
public
emails
http://dailycaller.com/2012/02/02/holder%e2%80%99s-no-2-in-2009-gunwalking-
fast-and-furious-a-%e2%80%98terrific-idea%e2%80%99/
between former acting ATF
director Ken Melson and Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, the head of
the DOJ’s Criminal Division, in which Breuer describes what appears to be Fast
and Furious gun-walking tactics as a ""terrific idea"" in 2009 \-- House
oversight committee Democrats claim that high-ranking DOJ officials never knew
about or approved gun-walking.
Gowdy described a lengthy report that the committee’s ranking member,
Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, released earlier this week as ""demonstrably
false.""
""Look, they’re wrong,"" he said.
""That one email proves it.
The phrase 'Wide
Receiver' is never used in that email, it’s
James
Trusty and
Jason
Weinstein, they’re talking about Fast and Furious, they mention gun-walking,
they talk about the press consequences of it, nobody ever gets around to
talking about the moral implications of it, they just more worried about the
press.""
Gowdy added that if had more time with Holder during the hearing, he would
have proven how gun laws already on the books \-- if Holder’s DOJ and ATF
actually enforced them rather than not following them themselves \-- would
have been more than enough to keep them from needing to arm the Mexican drug
cartels to make a case for new gun laws.
Democrats on the committee and Holder argued that new gun laws would have kept
ATF agents who weren’t enforcing the gun laws already on the books from
letting guns walk.
""Had we had another round of questions, I was going to prove to the Attorney
General \-- which he already knows -- that there are plenty of gun laws on the
books right now, that if used, could have more than adequately prosecuted this
case,"" Gowdy said.
""So, the notion that the fix is: 'We just got to get
Congress to pass more gun laws' is just sheer sophistry.
And, I could have
proven that, but I only got, what, eight minutes?""
Gowdy might get another chance soon.
""The more hearings the merrier,"" he told
TheDC.
""At some point, the chairman is going to have to decide whether or not to
force to the issue of making DOJ turn over documents post-February 4,"" Gowdy
said.
""No one believes that they’re doing it only to stand on principle.
There’s something in those documents they do not want us to see.
So, yeah,
until we can answer those questions, they
Democrats and Holder
can talk
about politics all they want.""
Gowdy, a prosecutor before entering politics, shrugs off the partisan
criticism against Republicans seeking answers and accountability for Fast and
Furious victims.
""I actually worked for the Justice Department that was headed by Janet Reno
Bill Clinton’s Attorney General ,"" he said.
""So, yeah, the good thing about
prosecutors and law enforcement is there’s no Republican or Democrat.
It’s
just the facts.
And, you shouldn’t be afraid to disclose them.
But, for
whatever reason they’re not going to turn over those documents and we’ll stay
on it until they do.""
""It’s not about Eric Holder, to me, as much as it is the reputation and the
integrity of the top law enforcement official in this country and the
Department of Justice,"" Gowdy added.
""It’s not about politics.
If it were
about politics, I’d say give us Jason Weinstein,
James
Trusty,
Lanny
Breuer.
It’s about being able to look my constituents in the eyes and say you
can have trust in the Department of Justice, because right now, the way it
looks to me, is that they are engaged in this deflecting the blame, 'we’re
going to make you prove it,'
'we’re not going to give you documents unless
there’s a court order.'
That’s just unacceptable to me.""

**Obama can stop Holder's Fast and Furious cover-up today**
The Washington Examiner
says
http://washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/2012/02/obama-can-stop-holders-
fast-and-furious-cover-today/238376
it appears that Attorney General Eric
Holder didn't read the executive order President Obama issued on his first day
in the White House. Obama pledged that his administration would provide the
American people with ""an unprecedented level of openness in government.""
Either he didn't read it or Holder thinks the executive order doesn't cover
Operation Fast and Furious, the misguided Justice Department program that
allowed thousands of weapons to be sold in the United States to known
gunrunners for Mexican drug cartels. The idea was the government would then
track the ""walked"" guns, thus enabling prosecution of cartel figures by
linking them to particular weapons found at crime scenes. But officials lost
track of an estimated 1,400 such guns, two of which turned up at the scene of
U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry's slaying in Arizona in December 2010.
Terry's slaying sparked a national uproar and prompted an investigation by the
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa.
The committee described the response of Holder's department to that
investigation in a report released last Thursday:
""For months, the department has stonewalled committee document requests and
refused to comply with committee subpoenas. The department has produced scores
of blacked-out pages containing no information and many duplicate documents in
order to bolster its page count. Recently, the
Justice Department's
Inspector General office disclosed that it has reviewed approximately 80,000
pages of documents related to Fast and Furious, and conducted approximately 70
interviews in its investigation. That investigation is not even close to
completion.
""In comparison, the department has produced just over 6,000 pages to Congress,
representing only 8% of the materials available to the IG. The department is
withholding 92% of the documents it has given the IG. Also, Congress has
conducted 22 interviews -- only 31% of the total the IG has already conducted.
If the department granted Congress access to all the documents and witnesses
available to the IG, it would be much closer to determining who was actually
responsible for Fast and Furious.""
The committee's use of the word ""stonewall"" is significant. The word became
famous when President Nixon and his senior aides used it in discussing their
response to inquiries about the Watergate break-in of 1972. It led in turn to
the now-familiar maxim that the cover-up is always worse than the original
crime.
Holder and his fellow Obama political appointees at the Justice Department
aren't kidding anybody within or outside Congress: They are furiously
stonewalling the Issa panel's investigation even as they hide behind an
obviously empty claim that they are defending the separation of powers between
Congress and the executive branch. When only 8 percent of the requested
documents are produced and witnesses either refuse to testify while citing
their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination or are barred from
testifying by their executive branch superiors, it becomes obvious that the
political appointees are covering up actions that are either criminal in
nature or that they fear would be politically damaging to Obama. If Obama
meant what he wrote in his first executive order, the cover-up by his Justice
Department appointees could stop as soon as he orders it. If he doesn't, he
endorses the cover-up.

**An oldie but goodie
**Gunrunner/Fast and Furious was one of the first things that Obama and Holder
did when they assumed power.
Posted before but needs to be revisited.
The simple fact is Barack Obama was the architect of Fast & Furious.
Holder
was the contractor.
On March 24, 2009, just sixty days after the inauguration, Deputy Attorney
General David Ogden announced from the White House that, ""the president has
directed us to take action.... and Attorney General Holder and I have taken
several new and aggressive steps...""
In government terms that's that's a Priority I project.
That's a fast-track
project.
Ogden goes on to describe those ""aggressive"" steps, saying to ""fortify its
Project Gunrunner... specifically to facilitate gun tracing...""
How can Holder hide from the fact that he initiated Project Gunrunner/Fast &
Furious at the direction of Barack Obama?
The evidence?
This public statement from Deputy Attorney General Ogden.

As part of our new series, "" A Look Inside WeddingWire HQ,"" we want to give
you an insider's look into our office located just outside Washington, D.C. in
Bethesda, Maryland. **We are excited to show you our office, introduce you to
some of the key members of our team, and much more!**
There's no better place to start than our entrance, here you can see our entry
way and just a glimpse into one of our main conference rooms which we've aptly
named for the road our office is located on. After just a few years, some of
the more senior team members can remember they days when the whole company
could fit into that conference room! Now we can barely fit one team and are
looking forward to showing you all the ways we have expanded.

to a Negative Review""
!
http://assets.weddingwire.com/images/vendors/blogs/negativereview.jpg A
former client wrote an unflattering review of your services and now you’re
worried about how this will affect future business. Fortunately, WeddingWire
allows you to “Respond” to reviews in an effort to remedy the situation and
deflect potential damage, but it’s important to consider _when_ and _how_ you
respond. By responding appropriately to a client’s review, even if you don’t
agree with their comments, you show that you take a personal interest in your
business and care to make it better. Before you get started, keep these few
tips in mind:
* **Your responses are made public on WeddingWire** : Don’t write anything you wouldn’t want a potential client to see. If you come across as aggressive, argumentative or disingenuous, potential customers will see this as a turn-off and eliminate you from their list of potential vendors. Write with your prospects in mind.
* **Respond when you’re at fault** : If someone leaves a review with legitimate concerns and complaints, it’s in your best interest to try to correct the situation. Apologize and explain why it won’t happen again, and offer a remedy to the particular situation.
* **Respond when the review states incorrect information** : Politely correct the reviewer. Sometimes a review is written for the incorrect business, so step in and take this as an opportunity to educate potential customers on your pricing, policies and business practices.
* **Don’t add fuel to the fire** : Some clients will never be satisfied with the service you provided. Don’t waste your time trying to convince them otherwise, and encourage other clients to write a positive review to balance this one out.
* **Never respond when you’re still angry** : Whether you had a bad day, or the client was difficult to please, remember that you can’t satisfy everyone. Personal attacks and a defensive attitude will not win you future business.
* **Keep it simple** : When you choose it’s appropriate to respond, keep your comments to about 5 concise sentences and move on.
Be proactive and encourage all of your clients to write reviews of your
business on WeddingWire. Customers use this information to evaluate your
business and make informed decisions – be responsive, approachable and
professional! When you are logged into your account you will see a link below
all of your reviews if you like to ""Respond.""

2012: Hear from the Winners!""
On January 9, we eagerly announced the 2012 winners of WeddingWire Bride’s
Choice Awards™. The prestigious annual awards program recognizes the best
local wedding vendors from the WeddingWire Network who demonstrate excellence
in quality, service, responsiveness and professionalism within the wedding
industry. It was with great pleasure that we congratulated the winners for
their continued professionalism and commitment to enriching the wedding
planning experience for engaged couples.
Now, we’re thrilled to share the benefits and successes directly from some of
our award-winning wedding professionals!

WeddingWire has been an invaluable tool in helping to grow my business.
**Engaged couples need to feel confident in their choice of vendors and the
reviews on WeddingWire provide just that. The Bride’s Choice Award is a
recognition that a vendor has performed well on a consistent basis throughout
the year and that recognition benefits both the vendor and the couple.** The
couples I meet tell me how impressed they are with my work and reviews. What
could be better than that?""____ ** __**

Award for the 3_ _ _ _ _rd year in a row! We’ve found that engaged couples
want to read reviews from past clients, especially because, a lot of a wedding

Pinterest? Optimize Your Pins""
Pinterest has been spreading the nation like wildfire, allowing users to 'pin'
photos and inspiration of their favorite recipes, clothing, hair, designs, and
more! Many brides
and hopeful-brides
have been using Pinterest as a new way
to organize inspiration for their weddings!
**Take advantage of this new social vertical to spread photos and links from
your website and blog.** It is important to keep a few SEO
Search Engine
Optimization
considerations in mind. Here are three areas to make sure you
are optimizing your photos on Pinterest for SEO:
!
http://assets.weddingwire.com/images/vendors/blogs/pinterest.jpg
**Description - **When you set up your profile, consider including some of
your relavent keywords and details in your Pinterest description, make sure to
include your category
i.e. Photographer, Florist, DJ
and the word ""weddings""
if this is your primary business! This way, when potential clients are
searching
on Google or Pinterest
you can increase your chances of showing up
as a result.
**Boards -** Choose the title of your 'Pin Boards' carefully! This is another
area to include keywords, consider doing so both in the title and description
of the boards where you organize your types of photos.
**Images -** Ensure you are using the proper direct links to the photo from
your website or blog so that you get the added benefits when your photos go
viral and those who share your images are properly directed back to your site.

Something occurred to me recently. Times have really changed. We no longer
live in a world where Ricky Martin is having to swear he isn’t gay. Instead,
he’s having to swear that ** he isn’t gay
married
http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/confidential/ricky-martin-
denies-marriage-reports/story-e6frf96o-1226236336972 **!
I never thought I’d see the day.
But, here we are with 6 states
Massachusetts, Iowa, New York, New Hampshire,
Vermont and Connecticut
and the District of Columbia proudly offering
marriage licenses to all couples -- gay and straight alike -- while another 2
states
Maryland and Washington
have opened the 2012 season jockeying to see
which can claim to be the eighth jurisdiction to legalize gay marriage.
Further, there are several other states -- including Illinois, Hawaii,
Delaware, Rhode Island, and New Jersey -- offering civil unions and other
broad partnership recognition rights to same sex couples. You can learn more
about the **map of marriage equality**
** here
http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/ .**
!
http://assets.weddingwire.com/images/vendors/blogs/lgbt_map.jpg
**This means that** **Wedding Pros in these areas should be making some
conscious decisions about their marketing materials and the audience to whom
they wish to speak if they haven’t already done so**. More than ever, gay and
lesbian couples are out there and the audience is listening.

http://vendorblog.weddingwire.com/wp-
content/uploads/2008/07/ms-weddings.jpg This week we
announced the completion
of our integration
http://www.weddingwire.com/shared/PressReleases
with the
MarthaStewart.com Weddings
http://www.marthastewart.com/weddings
website.
Engaged users planning their weddings will now be able to search our vendor
catalog right on MarthaStewart.com. In addition, our robust suite of planning
tools is also going to now live on their website as well.
This marks a few months of development that has gone into this integration
project and we're really excited about it. As WeddingWire vendors, your
listing now will get published on both sites, which means increased visibility
for you.
Find your listing on
MarthaStewart.com/weddings
http://www.marthastewart.com/weddings
here.
P.S. - Your reviews show up as well so be sure to continue asking your past
clients for those reviews.

http://vendorblog.weddingwire.com/wp-
content/uploads/2008/06/digg-logo1.jpg Such a simple phrase with such
possibilities. When was the last time you submitted any news or a webpage to
Digg.com
http://digg.com/ ? For those not familiar, Digg is one of the
largest social media sites consisting solely of user generated content. Using
Digg can be a great way to create new links to your website
links are a big
piece of the search engine optimization game . If you have a blog, Digg your
blog content with social bookmarks
like at the beginning or end of the post
and be sure to add a description about the submission. However, do NOT copy
the first few lines of your article into the description. Duplicate content is
not advised.
Additionally, your visitors can also Digg your posts right on your blog using
Digg Tools
http://digg.com/tools/
if you're feeling fancy
or want your
webmaster to do it .
Remember, content is still most important so be sure to give your visitors
something to Digg.
**Try Digg by selecting the button below this link that matches the ""Digg Guy""
